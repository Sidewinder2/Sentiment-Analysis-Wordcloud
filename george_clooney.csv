"argo_2012","Finally got around to watching this film, should have done so sooner. Stellar performances by Cranston, Arkin, Goodman & of course Affleck. The film didn't rush any of its acts, it instead took its time to build up tension & anticipation for the final act.

"argo_2012","Another really well done movie by Affleck. What a talent the guy is. Story about a group of people in the U.S. embassy who need to escape Iran during a major revolution. Historically its great because you really feel likes its 1979. Casting Alan Arkin was great for some comic relief. Good movie.","40","Mystery & Suspense, Drama","ben affleck|alan arkin|john goodman|bryan cranston|taylor schilling|tate donovan"
"argo_2012","The writing, the music and the suspense is all really well put together and that is a credit to Affleck, George Clooney and Chris Terrio. They blended a lot of the real-life events that happened, including the secret award Mendez received for his efforts, and passing on credit to the Canadians (their fake-movie was a Canadian film) before it became declassified until the late 90s. The only criticism I have of it is I believed it took too long setting up, and not enough time showing their struggles when in Iran, but that's simply nit-picking. Argo is a very good film, and one deserving of its Oscar win.","40","Mystery & Suspense, Drama","ben affleck|alan arkin|john goodman|bryan cranston|taylor schilling|tate donovan"

"argo_2012","What I love about Ben Affleck's 'Argo' is that it is a movie that maintains a breakneck intensity upon every viewing. I was always captivated by the story and was constantly just wondering how these people were going to escape. This a great thriller that is equal parts a great drama. Affleck delivers in both acting and directing. He builds the tension so naturally and does a stellar job directing the film. It is one of those movies I can just watch over and over againa and truly enjoy it. The story is captivating, the tension is nail biting, and the movie even delivers some good humorous moments. It's the complete package and is a must see movie.","50","Mystery & Suspense, Drama","ben affleck|alan arkin|john goodman|bryan cranston|taylor schilling|tate donovan"

"argo_2012","A political thriller about the Iranian hostage situation in the early 80s. This tells the untold story of the American hero behind the scenes CIA guy who saved their asses and thwarted a possible war situation. Its incredible that this idea was even thought of or approved and that it actually was pulled off. I've heard of the Iranian American embassy hostage situation taking forever (almost 2 years), but didn't ever hear about these particular hostages who escaped. These poor people are caught in a horrible situation just because of their nationality. The tension was so thick in this film you could cut it with a knife. For that reason, along with the ingenuity and meticulousness of the plot to escape- you can't help but cheer them on. One of my fav Affleck films and while it had some of his 'cool guy' that tries too hard in the script, it didn't get too heavy handed. Also, unlike a lot of political films this movie was very easy to follow and wasn't bogged down with govt. jargon.","40","Mystery & Suspense, Drama","ben affleck|alan arkin|john goodman|bryan cranston|taylor schilling|tate donovan"

"argo_2012","Argo is the political thriller based on the 1979 Iranian hostage situation in which 6 Americans were left to fend for themselves in the centre of Tehran. CIA Operative Tony Mendez (played by Ben Affleck) is sent into Iran to evacuate the Americans out safely under the cover of being a film production crew working on a picture called 'Argo'.The film is absolutely amazing and definitely one of the best films I've seen in a long time, throughout 2012 and 2013 so far we have been treated with some great films such as Skyfall, Django Unchained, Life of Pi, Les Miserables, Zero Dark Thirty and more, but in my own personal opinion Argo takes the bait as the best of them all. Proof is present as it won 3 BAFTA's for best picture, best director and best editing, also nominated for a further 8 Oscars in 85th Academy Awards.The film is packed with a sense of threat, peril and intensity all portrayed exceptionally well through the ensemble cast including Ben Affleck (The Town), John Goodman (Big Lebowski), Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), Alan Arkin (Edward Scissorhands) and Victor Garber (Titanic). The ending is by far the most intense ending I have seen in a long time, visually presented in such an astounding way.Director Ben Affleck started out his auteur career after his directional debut Gone Baby Gone became critically acclaimed, three years later The Town came out with an Oscar nomination. Now 2 years on we have Argo, Affleck's best film by far.","50","Mystery & Suspense, Drama","ben affleck|alan arkin|john goodman|bryan cranston|taylor schilling|tate donovan"

"argo_2012","Argo Fuck Yourself.......","45","Mystery & Suspense, Drama","ben affleck|alan arkin|john goodman|bryan cranston|taylor schilling|tate donovan"
"argo_2012","WHAT I LIKED: We knew by this point that Ben Affleck can both act and direct to an incredible standard, but he still manages to surprise us with every great turn he makes. This time, he pulled out all the stops and as a result 'Argo' is one of the most inventively put together and well directed films of 2012 (and that's saying something by the way). He really grips you through each creative montage and scene change; it actually feels like the events are unfolding before your very eyes at points, and this journey is often aided by the contrasting performances and tones that the movie straddles. Somehow it's incredibly engaging and exciting, whilst also scarcastically mocking and entertaining at times...WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: As I said, manier contrast this film doth straddle - and whilst it mostly gels, it occasionaly doesn't. I feel the tonal confusion that this creates is mainly apparent in the lengthly set-up, but at least it's diminished by the end.VERDICT: What's most apparent is just how well-made Argo is, but that doesn't stop you from properly engaging and having a great time with it. Well done again Mr Affleck, you've outdone yourself.","40","Mystery & Suspense, Drama","ben affleck|alan arkin|john goodman|bryan cranston|taylor schilling|tate donovan"
"argo_2012","All this kicked off when I was but a mere sprog at the tender age of 1 year old, that's a long time ago folks. So Affleck steps up to the podium with an attempt at an epic, gritty, realistic political rollercoaster which is based on a true story where there wasn't actually that much danger truth be told.Based on true events and more recently an article about the whole charade. The story involves a small group of Americans trapped in Iran after the US embassy was stormed and taken by militants. The group pretty much hide away in various places, moving around somewhat with the help of other foreign embassy folk until the Canadian Ambassador 'takes them in'. From there on the CIA conjure up a plan to extract the lost escapees by hoaxing the scouting of a major motion sci-fi picture and pretending the six Americans are crew members.On the visual side of things this film did impress me, its pretty flawless as Iran is recreated right down to small details that were captured on film at the time (a man strung up by a large crane downtown). The clothes, hairstyles, cars, interior decorations, technology etc...are all spot on and captures the late 70's perfectly. The cast are all terrific and perform beautifully, I admit I don't know who most of them are (the escapees mainly) but they do a sterling job.Alan Arkin is by far the best thing going for the A list actors on show. His gruff, rude outspoken manner is brilliant for his character of the film producer Lester Siegel (fictional character), great Hollywood type name too. John Goodman is here again!! this time he does a good job as old Hollywood makeup artist John Chambers. Not only is his calm demeanour very likeable and pleasant but he actually looks like the guy too.When it comes to the lead role of 'Mendez' played by Affleck I gotta take a step back from my enjoyment of the film. Like I say I did enjoy the film, but a nagging thought in my head just keeps telling me Affleck gave or saved the best meatiest role for himself...simply because it was his film and he could.Yes Affleck does OK in the role, there is no machoism going on, no over the top acting, its all very straight laced and plain. But the fact his character was Latino and I don't think Affleck really looked like the guy either kinda makes me wonder why he just didn't cast someone more appropriate. Yes I realise what I just said doesn't mean Affleck wouldn't be good for the role and not give the right performance, but because he was the director I just sense a bit of self indulgence really. Meh! but that's just me.So yep this was truly daring stuff, the kind of thing you'd half expect to hear from a dashing WWII adventure by us crafty Brits. As usual though we do have the problem of the Yanks taking a lot of credit for themselves and ignoring everyone else. As with a few other war stories, certain other parties involved in this plot have unfortunately been given a bit of the cold shoulder. To the common viewer it won't make a difference of course but to those involved it has been noticed and caused a slight stir.Most of the film is a build up for the finale which doesn't disappoint I guarantee. The whole finale is a bit predictable naturally but it still grabs you by the collar. Even the build up is interesting which surprised me as I expected lots of dull political/government spiel from lots of grey suited blokes with thick rimmed glasses and hair partings you could sail a boat down.The film in general, I must give kudos to Affleck and his team for what they have achieved. Despite the need for adding a few Hollywood moments to rack up the tension like the runway chase and various sweat inducing confrontations, the film is reasonably accurate and highly enjoyable. Probably the most exciting tense ride I've experienced in a film for sometime where no one actually gets shot or killed!","35","Mystery & Suspense, Drama","ben affleck|alan arkin|john goodman|bryan cranston|taylor schilling|tate donovan"

"argo_2012","Argo is a 2012 American political thriller film directed by Ben Affleck and written by Chris Terrio. Based on actual events, this suspenseful film has plenty of critics but does well to show the social intricacies and tragedies of the Iranian life and international politics. The film is adapted from U.S. Central Intelligence Agency operative Tony Mendez's book The Master of Disguise and Joshuah Bearman's 2007Wired article 'The Great Escape: How the CIA Used a Fake Sci-Fi Flick to Rescue Americans from Tehran.' The latter deals with the 'Canadian Caper,' in which Mendez led the rescue of six U.S. diplomats from Tehran, Iran, during the 1979-1981 Iran hostage crisis.","40","Mystery & Suspense, Drama","ben affleck|alan arkin|john goodman|bryan cranston|taylor schilling|tate donovan"

"three_kings","From the very beginning, Three Kings isn't a typical war film. The first act is almost straight-up comedy, and even as the film progresses into a bit more familiar territory, there remains something oddly jarring within the way David O. Russell tells this story, although perhaps some of that can be chalked up to some strange stylistic choices. An anti-war stance takes precedence here, and is unrelenting in proving that message. The film has no shame in throwing punches at United States foreign policy under the Bush administration and the involvement in Iraq at the end of the Persian Gulf War, and works quite effectively in that regard. The film does manage to blend in effective sequences of wartime action and hard-hitting moments, especially towards the end of the film. The four lead performances here are all top notch, including career-igniting performances from George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg and solid turns from Ice Cube and Spike Jonze (in one of his rare acting appearances).One of O. Russell's earlier films is one of his best. While the ending sags and somewhat fails to live up to the rest of the film, it's a rousing film that's simultaneously entertaining and thoughtful in what it has to say.","40","Action & Adventure, Comedy","mark wahlberg|george clooney|ice cube|spike jonze|nora dunn|jamie kennedy"

"three_kings","I enjoy stories like this where people with dishonorable intentions are turned to honorable actions because their conscience gets the better of them. This movie really hits the ground running by setting the scene and almost immediately putting the plot in motion. I think one problem with this is that I don't get much time to connect with the main characters and care about why they are committing this criminal act. As the film progresses the events make me like the characters more, but I think it would have helped if that came at the beginning. Once things get going I was a little confused over what was happening and what the plan was, but the movie went from confusing to straightforward as the plot progressed so I didn't mind too much. I like how the tables are turned on our protagonists and some of the mistreatment that they doled out is given right back to them. It made you question which actions are justifiable, and also the way the war in the Middle East was executed. Clooney, Wahlberg, and Cube were all perfect casting decisions because they can pull off selfish jerks at the beginning and also selfless protectors at the end. There was something about the pacing of the story that felt very choppy, though, and I didn't really enjoy that. I think it is overall a well-executed story, but there's some ineffable quality to the film that I didn't connect with emotionally. So when heavy things are happening (like torture) I felt strangely disconnected instead of impacted. I'm glad I saw Three Kings, and I think many people would enjoy it, but I don't think I'll ever seek it out again.","35","Action & Adventure, Comedy","mark wahlberg|george clooney|ice cube|spike jonze|nora dunn|jamie kennedy"

"three_kings","David O' Russell's Three Kings is a fantastic movie that was probably what people didn't expect it to be. It does seem like David O' Russell focuses on the characters a lot which I'm perfectly fine with as they are memorable. That's not the only aspect that he focused on as he focus on the humor which is really funny, and the plot which is really good and a bit unexpected s this takes place after the Gulf War when some of the characters basically have nothing else better to do. The action is really good and exciting that's like Anthony and Joe Russo when they did Captain America: The Winter Soldier, it's unexpected to see a comedy director that direct action scenes, especially if they are done well. The writing is really good, and the acting from Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, George Clooney, and Spike Jonze are really great. My mom would probably think that Three Kings is an all right film as it's really weird like David O' Russell's other films, which I also think that it's weird, but it's a 'weird masterpiece' as the late Roger Ebert quoted this film.","50","Action & Adventure, Comedy","mark wahlberg|george clooney|ice cube|spike jonze|nora dunn|jamie kennedy"

However, complications arise and they find themselves on a rescue mission with no support.

"three_kings","'What is the problem with Michael Jackson?''Three Kings' isn't David O. Russell's best film (albeit it's close) but it certainly is his most underrated film in my opinion and that irks me for a few reasons. For one, the film features one of the funniest and perfectly satirical scripts of all time. Probably the only film I've seen about the Gulf War where shit actually goes down quite a few times, which is hilarious in its own right, considering that not a whole lot of action happened. For two, the acting is fucking brilliant and Spike Jonze plays one of the wildest and most zany characters in any film. Goddamn, Clooney is the fucking man. And holy shit, Jamie Kennedy is one dumb motherfucker in this movie but it's a hilarious process to see unfold as the film goes on. For three, Newton Thomas Sigel is one of my favorite cinematographers working today. Every single shot in this movie is something of pure wonder. I particularly love Newton's hyper speed shots and electric camera motion, it perfectly captures the energy of this film. The editing also compliments the flick. For four, Carter Burwell has crafted one of the best 90's movie soundtracks for sure. It's such an alluring and marvelously diverse music selection which adds to the mood and spirit of TK. Also, S/O to Carter for including 'If You Leave Me Now' by Chicago in it. Absolutely brilliant.The only real problem I have with the movie is that I feel around the halfway point, the film drags a bit when the action dies down. The pacing isn't perfect and thankfully, it's saved when the last quarter of the film picks it all back up again.Overall, I highly recommend Three Kings to anyone who loves a biting satire and some good action to go along with it.","45","Action & Adventure, Comedy","mark wahlberg|george clooney|ice cube|spike jonze|nora dunn|jamie kennedy"
"three_kings","The cinema by Newton Thomas Sigel is perhaps the most interesting quality; it blends nice desert scenery with unconventional angles and quasi-surrealism. But there's still the issue of credibility. When the conflict in the Persian Gulf is symbolized by Ice Cube throwing a bomb-fitted Nerf football at a helicopter, that's where I stop believing. It's not a bad film from a technical standpoint. I guess I just don't approve of the concept.","20","Action & Adventure, Comedy","mark wahlberg|george clooney|ice cube|spike jonze|nora dunn|jamie kennedy"

"three_kings","Three Kings is a really cool, fun movie. A screwball war movie.. probably the only of it's kind. It follows the three U.S marines, from AWOL to altruism. In the end, it preaches the concept that helping innocent people escape tyranny is what fighting wars should really be about. Interestingly, it criticizes George Bush for pulling out of Iraq too quickly, and not saving the Iraqi's by just getting Saddam right then and there. Pre-9/11 times seemed more open to fighting in Iraq.. but then three years later, we went in to finish up the job, and nobody was on board with it. Think of it as you will, it's a political movie after all. It's critique on American foreign policy remains relevant today, perhaps even more than ever. Other than the politics, David O. Russell made a pretty exceptional first film.. despite raising hell through his fascist methods as a director. The entire film is engaging, wild and free. Almost reminiscent of a young Oliver Stone. The cast is solid. Mark Wahlberg, from his Dirk Diggler days, steals the show in every scene. Overall, it's a great watch.","45","Action & Adventure, Comedy","mark wahlberg|george clooney|ice cube|spike jonze|nora dunn|jamie kennedy"

"1197696_fantastic_mr_fox?","Though I occasionally had issues with how the characters seem to at times, especially the titular character, not have any facial expressions and can only express their feelings with their eyes and for our hero a forced smile occasionally, Fantastic Mr. Fox still shows that even directors more experienced in live-action can direct a surprisingly good animated movie. With most of the books I read at home back when I was in seventh grade as you Americans call it being written by the late Roald Dahl otherwise known by Screen Junkies as 'Creepy Dr. Seuss', I wanted to see the film adaptation of the book. Back then, all I saw was a decent comedy that ended far too quickly and managed to extend its source material to great new heights without succumbing to what I like to call 'The Dr. Seuss Movie Curse'. Now that I've grown up a bit I notice it has a more adult-oriented apporach with still enough charm to appeal to children. This movie and Coraline were actually refreshing movies to watch in 2009 since we got to take a break from CGI for a while. There were actually some really great shots thanks to the fewer limitations of animation. It sometimes even feels like a 2D side-scrolling video game. The movie's funny with slapstick jokes such as Mr. Fox and his opossum friend to dialogue-based jokes an example of which is Bill Murray's description of the three bad guy farmers and Advertised Extra Owen Wilson describing a fictional sport with complicated rules. And George Clooney nails it as Mr. Fox. He really does, I'm not saying that just to be polite or anything. Since this is my first Wes Anderson movie, I can't praise his sense of humour as heavily as in his other movies. So, if I were to write a definition for this movie in Urban Dictionary, what would I say? Fantastic Mr. Fox: A stop-motion movie released in 2009 that no one saw because...it's not CGI, I guess? Which is a shame because the movie's hilarious with a clever plot, witty humour and great voice-acting with George Clooney doing a great job at delivering a 'click-click' noise that serves as the Fox's trademark. If you haven't watched it, go see it now. And I have severe doubts that reading the book will make you say 'THIS MOVIE FREAKIN' SUCKS!!!' after watching the movie for a second time.

"1197696_fantastic_mr_fox?","Fantastic Mr. Fox is directed and co-written by Wes Anderson, and it stars George Clooney, Meryl Streep, and Jason Schwartzman in a stop-motion animated film about a fox that move his family over to a big tree that's surrounded by 3 people that want to kill the fox for stealing their products. When I was at the city library, trying to copy something, I realize that I should rent some movies that I wouldn't be able to watch on TV unless it's actually now playing them. So I got myself some Sofia Coppola films and some Christian films as I heard they are terrible, and I wanted to torture myself for fun. Then I tried to think of another film to watch, and once I was thinking of my best friend, I knew that I wanted to rent this movie as this is one of her favorites, and I haven't seen this in a long time. So of course I watched this first, and I find this a lot of fun to watch. The voice acting is fantastic in this, which is kind of funny to see George Clooney and Bill Murray's characters go at each other by just growling at them. The animation is amazing that even the big things that it does in this film look so simple and easy, which I know that the animators worked very hard on it, and the effects show in this. The characters are very enjoyable to watch, especially Kylie who's played by Wallace Wolodarsky, which I didn't know he was an actor as he's a writer in some of the early Simpsons episodes, and wrote the third Wimpy Kid movie, and he plays the main character's accomplice which he sometimes just stand there dazing and not paying attention, which always makes me laugh for some reason. The script by Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach is very witty and hilarious that I was enjoying almost every second of this film, and it didn't felt quirky for the sake of being quirky and nothing else.

"1197696_fantastic_mr_fox?","I still have significant issues with Wes Anderson and the way he tells stories. There's this matter-of-fact way that people behave and talk that is off-putting to me. I can't count the number of times someone just tells you exactly what they are doing or are planning to do. And whenever something out of the ordinary occurs there is rarely a reaction, everyone behaves as if every moment is exactly what they expected. The one good thing about this style is that it prepared me so that I wasn't in the least bit surprised when the humans and animals just started communicating with each other as if they all spoke the same language. There were some humorous moments in Fantastic Mr. Fox that did work for me. I laughed occasionally at the physical humor and some of the running gags. I should also give a lot of credit to the skill that I know it took to make the stop-motion animation work. I've never been the biggest fan of how stop motion looks, and this is probably my least favorite ever. The fur on the animals looked scratchy like everything is made out of straw. I'd rather look at old Rankin/Bass Christmas specials than this stuff. Still I recognize the art that goes into this style of film. It takes so much talent and patience, so I feel like a jerk for not loving it. The story of Fantastic Mr. Fox worked better for me than Wes Anderson's typical movie. It seemed a little more clear cut and there were actual motivations for all the characters that made sense. I just wish I liked the characters more. I mean, Mr. Fox might be on my list of least sympathetic protagonists ever. I don't think there's a single thing he does in this movie that redeems him for me. They certainly try to make us forgive him, but it never worked for me. Then his son, Ash, is a jealous bully. That also makes me want to scream. So, a strong story with some effective humor, but with unlikable main characters and odd style. I'd say Fantastic Mr. Fox is definitely not a film for me.","25","Action & Adventure, Animation, Kids & Family, Comedy","george clooney|meryl streep|jason schwartzman|bill murray|wallace wolodarsky|eric chase anderson"

After a successful heist the farmers wage war on the foxes and want to catch them at any cost, putting all the animals near by in danger.

"1083436_1083436_out_of_sight?","It's not that Out of Sight is some sort of monumental motion picture, however, it's a perfectly harmless feature film that entertains from beginning to end. It's one of Steven Soderbergh's more dated films, being that it was made 20 years ago, but it's also one of the sharpest in terms of dialogue and performances.On the outside, the romance between Jennifer Lopez and George Clooney is flooded with clichés. An underappreciated FBI agent falls for the very guy she's trying to take down. It's been done a thousand times over, and it's not like this time it's all that groundbreaking. But their romance is well-acted on both sides. Clooney does as good as he can playing bad-boy Jack Foley, but I'm not sure I can ever accept that face of his as an antagonist. And Lopez, who isn't known for her acting, is actually quite good as Karen Sisco.Unsurprisingly for a Soderbergh film, the cast as a whole is phenomenal. Clooney, Lopez, Cheadle, Zahn, Rhames, Keener, Farina, Brooks, Davis, Keaton, and the one and only Samuel L. Jackson round out one of the best ensemble casts of all time. The best part is, no one takes their jobs too seriously, but well enough to be effective.As I previously mentioned, Soderbergh's directing is a little dated. Part of it is because the way films were made in the 90's was way different than it is now. For one, the music they used seemed like something out of a cheesy adult film. I mean that in the most respectful way possible, it's just the vibe I got from it. The editing is also something I couldn't entirely get behind. It's obviously intentional on Soderbergh's part, but the weird pauses in shots before transitions to a new scene just seemed weird.With that said, Out of Sight is undeniably fun, smart, and re-watchable. There isn't a whole lot more you can ask from a movie. It's no Oceans' Eleven, but it's definitely something worth watching.7.7/10","35","Drama, Action & Adventure, Romance, Mystery & Suspense, Comedy","george clooney|jennifer lopez|ving rhames|don cheadle|dennis farina|albert brooks"

"1083436_1083436_out_of_sight?","While many may find him quite smug on occasion, George Clooney is an actor whose easy-going charm and charisma are impossible to ignore, but these elements are only one of the things that make Out Of Sight great. Boasting Jennifer Lopez's best on screen performance I've yet seen, faint praise I know, a clever story told in a trippy but fun manner, a sharp, dialogue-savvy screenplay and a host of terrific supporting players including Ving Rhames and Don Cheadle. Its flippancy is what makes it work, with serious story elements interlaced with witty, sardonic humour, and while it may amount to a simple enough conclusion, and loses steam towards the end as it forgoes its tongue-in-cheek tone to bring everything to a rudimentary climax, the film is solid proof that the journey is often far better than the destination.

"1083436_1083436_out_of_sight?","This sets up an interesting premise in the first 30 minutes as George Clooney seems to be able to talk his way out of any situation.

I didn't really care about the big score they were trying to make. There are so many good actors in this movie but it just didn't hold my interest all the way through. Part of it may be Soderbergh. I went back and looked at which movies he's done and other than the Ocean's series I really don't like any of the ones I've seen.","25","Drama, Action & Adventure, Romance, Mystery & Suspense, Comedy","george clooney|jennifer lopez|ving rhames|don cheadle|dennis farina|albert brooks"

"1083436_1083436_out_of_sight?","This is the movie that made me realize Soderbergh could make smart commercial films. Soderbergh made some terrific films prior to this, like 'Sex, Lies, and Videotape,' 'King of the Hill' and the very stylish 'Kafka,' but those were strictly arthouse films. Here Soderbergh takes a smart script by Scott Frank that adapts a very commercial Elmore Leonard novel with a cast of talented and gorgeous movie stars. George Clooney plays a bank robber who break out of prison and winds up kidnapping a federal agent, Jennifer Lopez, during his breakout. The two share a mutual attraction, but being on opposite sides of the law complicate things. The film's plot revolves around Clooney looking for a payout from a wealthy white collar ex-con who he protected in prison, but the film's real story is the complicated will they/won't they relationship between Clooney and Lopez. This film is easily the best film and best role that Lopez has had her entire career, and Clooney, who's filmography is filled with great films, this role and performance may arguably be one of his best. The dialogue is smart and funny, there is an amazingly strong supporting cast that includes Ving Rhames, Don Cheadle, Catherine Keener, Dennis Farina, Steve Zahn, Albert Brooks, Luis Guzmán, Isaiah Washington, Nancy Allen, Samuel L. Jackson in a bit part and Michael Keaton uncredited as Ray Ncolette, the same character he played in another Elmore Leonard film adaptation this same year, 'Jackie Brown.' But the real magic of this film is the chemistry between Clooney and Lopez. I could watch these two make goo-goo eyes at each other all day. From their first intimate scene when they are both sandwiched in a car trunk to the scene where they share a table at a nighttime high rise restaurant with snow falling on the city below, these who have to be one of the best on screen couples of all time. Elliot Davis richly photography the stars and composer David Holmes does a fine job balancing the films comedy with it's more moody moments. I think my only complaint about the film is that the climax drags on a bit, but it's still entertaining and I was super excited to see Nancy Allen laying the maid Midge (I've had a crush on her since '1941'). Overall, I consider this a real film classic that everyone should see if they haven't already.","45","Drama, Action & Adventure, Romance, Mystery & Suspense, Comedy","george clooney|jennifer lopez|ving rhames|don cheadle|dennis farina|albert brooks"

"1083436_1083436_out_of_sight?","Films glamorize criminality more than Ghirardelli chocolate commercials forget to remind you that sugar is bad for you, but I'm not complaining any time soon - so long as attractive actors and actresses continue to sin onscreen like they're the coolest people alive, puffing cigarettes and having clever existential glitterings of conversation, I'll be happy. Movies are a form of escapism, after all, and what's better than spending a couple of hours with do-badders who look good being bad? You forgot that Uma and John were playing pretty terrible people as they did the twist at Jack Rabbit Slim's. There's something enticing about living vicariously through individuals not affected by suburbia or midlife crises. We can save 'American Beauty' or 'Young Adult' for later. 'Out of Sight,' one of the finest comedy thrillers in a decade full of them, never stops the crime train for a minute and never allows for us to let our guards down. It is a film that rides high on the fumes of witty exchanges and effortless self-regard, just three-dimensional enough to get away with being so damn artificially snappy and just artificial enough to three-dimensionalize the fact that this is a movie, just one that happens to be remarkably and irrepressibly engaging. It is also widely touted as the role that made George Clooney a star and got him thrown into the typecast hell of playing charming, devil-may-care sinners. In 'Out of Sight,' he portrays Jack Foley, a bank robber so confident that the majority of his career has gone without gun use - he can easily convince a teller of a threat without actually having to prove himself. As the film opens, he's pulling yet another quick job (he's lost count) that travels down the wrong path after his car refuses to start. He's escaped jail time for years, with past encounters lasting long and throbbing with emptiness. This time, he refuses to give up. So he cooks up an escape plan that, more or less, works. But as his right-hand man, Buddy (Ving Rhames), waits outside the prison grounds for his partner-in-grime to jump out of a clichéd underground tunnel, U.S. Marshal Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez) is also passing the time in her car; and though she has a shotgun in hand, her attempts to thwart Jack and Buddy mid-escape fail. She is kidnapped, thrown into the trunk of her own car with Jack, with Buddy driving away into the night. But something strange happens: Jack and Karen find themselves liking each other, not in the way pals do but in the manner middle-schoolers dream of. Their trunk conversations consists not of threats and faux pas but of easygoing small-talk (Faye Dunaway, for instance, is a topic). It's a shame that she sides with the law and he smirks at it; then maybe they'd have something. Yet even after escape ensues and separation becomes reality, the two are still fascinated by one another, chance encounters fueling their flirtations as Jack eventually turns toward another job with Karen hot on his trail, in the throes of investigation but also of sexual interest. At its heart, 'Out of Sight' is a caper - but it's more fascinating when focused on the cat-and-mouse romance between its sexy leads, who have such crackling repartee that a mere glance emits a spark. Despite the linkage that almost immediately connects the two before first viewing, I was not reminded of 'Pulp Fiction' while watching 'Out of Sight' but of 'Jackie Brown.' This is the second time I've watched the film (the first being three summers ago), and more apparent to me is Steven Soderbergh's tight handling of a screenplay with a lot of characters, subplots, and misunderstandings. Like Tarantino, he doesn't figure a drawn-out scene regarding character quirks is such a bad thing - it provides dimension that ultimately makes the movie funnier. As we get to know the people involved, the more they seem like human beings (just catered with awesome dialogue) who commit crime for a living only because there isn't anything else to do. But then there's Lopez as the good guy, who bears noticeable self-possession that is thunderously carnal but also subtly infuriating - why doesn't she make more movies like this? Clearly, she can hold her own next to big names. By its end, 'Out of Sight' only slightly flies of the rails and loses some of its steam, but it hardly undoes the vibrancy seen previously. This is a movie that sees dialogue as a virtue, characters as people and not objects. I am in awe of its intelligence, the way it so whole-heartedly refuses to commit to genre norms. It takes familiar characteristics and renews them, freshly and unpredictably.","40","Drama, Action & Adventure, Romance, Mystery & Suspense, Comedy","george clooney|jennifer lopez|ving rhames|don cheadle|dennis farina|albert brooks"
"1083436_1083436_out_of_sight?","Elmore Leonard had been writing crime and western novels as far back as the 1950's and has had numerous adaptations of his work: Paul Newman in Hombre, Clint Eastwood in Joe Kidd and Charles Bronson in Mr. Majestyk are just some of the more familiar ones. However, around the mid 90's there was somewhat of a reinvestment in his work. After the release of Quentin Tarantino's hugely influential Pulp Fiction in 1994, crime became cool again and Elmore Leonard became the go-to guy for the material. John Travolta would follow-up Pulp with an adaptation of Leonard's Get Shorty and Tarantino himself adapted Rum Punch into Jackie Brown. There were other TV Movies like Gold Coast and Pronto, Paul Schrader's misjudged Touch and the short lived TV series Maximum Bob. Steven Soderbergh then rounded them off with this stylish film that, arguably, handed George Clooney the first role that suited him as a fully fledged leading man.Jack Foley (George Clooney) is a career bank robber that's done his fair share of jail time. After a recent breakout, he heads for Detroit to pull off his final job by relieving tycoon Richard Ripley (Albert Brooks) of his uncut diamond stash. However, Foley has to contend with other ex-cons with the same idea while evading the law and his infatuation with US Marshall Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez).Opening with the most remarkably cool and composed bank robbery you're ever likely to see, it's clear from the offset that Soderbergh and Clooney are on very fine form. The mood is also helped by an excellent score by David Holmes that taps into a 70's caper vibe while Soderbergh employs a whole host of stylistic, directorial flourishes; he cleverly plays with the time frame throughout the narrative with complex use of flashbacks and freeze frames and puts a fresh spin on film noir.Anyone familiar with Leonard's novels will be fully aware of his colourful characters and sharp, snappy dialogue. In bringing them to the screen, Soderbergh assembles a rich gallery of performers; despite Leonard envisioning Jack Nicholson or Sean Connery as Jack Foley when he sold the film rights of his novel, it's a role that fits Clooney like a glove. He brings the requisite charm and charisma and it remains one of his most perfectly suited roles to this day. He's accompanied by a stellar supporting cast too; Jennifer Lopez is not normally someone I'd rate very highly but she delivers some strong work as the doggedly determined Federal Marshall and shares great chemistry with Clooney. Ving Rhames brings his usual reliability as Foley's right hand man, Buddy Bragg while Steve Zahn adds welcome comic relief as stoner, Glenn Michaels. It's the dialogue and interplay between all of these characters that's one of the films major highlights and it provide numerous light, entertaining moments. However, these moments are balanced out with a well judged element of danger. For the most part, the personalities seem flawed and comical but Don Cheadle's chillingly psychotic Snoopy Miller, in particular, is a sobering reminder of what's at stake and what some of these career criminals are capable of.Despite the story predominantly taking place amongst unsavoury criminals, you could say that this is as much as a romantic drama as it is a crime drama and Soderbergh handles them both (and the comedy elements) with a deftness. The non-linear approach demands a certain concentration as it zips back and forth while teasingly bringing everything together. When you talk about the post-modern cool of 90's crime movies then this is certainly worthy of inclusion.Crime may be the angle of it's characters but the real crime was this being overlooked upon it's release. It didn't do well at the box-office and many have yet to still uncover this gem. Having been well versed in the work of Elmore Leonard over the years, I have to say that Soderbergh and screenwriter Scott Frank do an exemplary job here. Adaptations of Leonard's work have rarely been better.

"1083436_1083436_out_of_sight?","(54%)A clear Elmore Leonard based story with it's characters leaning both between crime and law enforcement, and sometimes even both. This has a little more than a connection with 'Jackie Brown', with Michael Keaton reprising his role which is something that doesn't happen very often in movies made by different people. This though isn't nowhere near as good as 'Jackie Brown', the characters aren't as well crafted, it doesn't have the depth, and the plot in general is not as good or well told. With that said it is an easier film to get into on the first watch, and it is likely to be Jennifer Lopez's best staring role of her acting career.

"1083436_1083436_out_of_sight?","In Steven Soderbergh's 'Out of Sight,' George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez have a dynamic charisma and sexual chemistry of movie stars from an earlier era - the kind that is largely missing in contemporary movies. Intelligently adapted by Scott Frank from Elmore Leonard's slick and entertaining novel, a bank robber (George Clooney) tries for one more score while getting involved romantically with a federal marshal (Jennifer Lopez) who is in pursuit of him. This is a well crafted, effortless entertainment with the charm and wit of Stanley Donen's 'Charade.' Soderbergh succeeded as the first director to rein in Clooney's mannerisms. Kudos to the inventive editing by Anne V. Coates.

I feel like most bigger films will have a documentary crew filming the events of the film's progression just in case some catastrophe or whatnot happens that will make for a good feature length making of, but that just usually doesn't happen. I'd have to say with Full Tilt Boogie, that didn't really happen either. Sure there were clashes with the Union and desert wind storms to deal with, but Lost in La Mancha, this is not. I really enjoyed it because I love seeing behind the scenes footage of film sets and it has pretty extensive interviews with most of the cast (except Harvey Keitel, but he's kind of a weirdo anyway) and crew. Probably not strong enough to get its own separate release, but a great companion piece to Dusk Till Dawn and a fine special feature that is included for free with the purchase of the Dawn dvd.","40","Documentary, Television, Horror, Special Interest","robert rodriguez|quentin tarantino|george clooney|juliette lewis|lawrence bender|fred williamson"

"far_from_heaven","Todd Haynes has often been an experimental director throughout his career. He tackled the Glam Rock era with the dazzling, if mid-judged, Velvet Goldmine and had 6 different actors portray various phases of Bob Dylan in I'm Not There. Most recently his adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's Carol made many critics and viewers' lists for the best film of 2015. Despite his creative ambitions, however, he's never really been recognised in terms of awards. The only Oscar nomination he has received was, in fact, an Original Screenplay one for this film. I've yet to see Carol (which apparently shares similarities with this) but so far, Far From Heaven is Haynes' masterpiece.Connecticut in 1957 finds Cathy (Julianne Moore) and Frank Whitaker (Dennis Quaid) as the seemingly perfect couple at the heart of their community. Frank has a secret, though, and when Cathy discovers his double life, she begins a friendship with her black gardener Raymond (Dennis Haysbert). But such behaviours soon invite the unwanted attention and scorn of their so-called friends and neighbours.As soon as this film opens, you are instantly struck by Elmer Bernstein's evocative score and a colourful palette that just radiates from the screen. It doesn't take long to realise that Haynes is paying homage to the film's of the 1950's. Douglas Sirk is a particular director that Haynes is emulating and recreating his melodramatic soap opera's like Imitation of Life or All That Heaven Allows is so convincing that you'd be forgiven for questioning whether or not you're watching a contemporary film. There's an intoxicating attention to detail whereby Haynes puts so much care into this film that you're transported back the 50's era. His efforts are so meticulous and refined that Far From Heaven is nothing less than a stunningly crafted piece of cinema. Peter Rogness' art design and Mark Friedberg's production design are simply splendid and the lavish costumes by Sandy Powell change throughout the film to suit the seasonal changes in the plot. All of this is perfectly framed by Edward Lachman's stunning cinematography. His use of light and vibrant, oversaturated colours keep in tune with the bold use of technicolor from Sirk's melodrama's and is absolutely exquisite work. Haynes' intention is to capture the nuclear, corporate family living the dream of white picket fence America and he does so with a confidence and hugely creative eye. Despite his accomplished recreation of the times, however, Haynes chooses an entirely different direction for his narrative. What sets his film apart from the style of Douglas Sirk is that Sirk's films were all very conservative, whereas Haynes' perfect suburbia is shattered by very personal problems that would have been taboo and risquÃ© by any standards during the 50's. Society, in Haynes' world, is full of casual racists and homophobes who view homosexuality as an illness and being kind to Negros socially unacceptable. The underrated Patricia Clarkson is the perfect embodiment for the judgmental rottenness that permeates the neighbourhood. She epitomises the very people of society that the three, inherently decent, principal characters of Quaid, Haysbert and Moore are up against. With the facade of some and anguish of others, it cuts across so many divides: gender, race, class, sexual orientation but although it's about several different levels of oppression it's, at it's heart, a story about the oppression of women. Ultimately, this is about a women's place at this time; how tolerant they were expected to be and how keeping up appearances was at the forefront of their place within a fractured, consumerist environment. With his experimental evocation, Haynes could easily fall prey to pretension but for as much style as the film has, it has content to match. Simply speaking, it's a work of art.Mark Walker","50","Drama, Romance","julianne moore|dennis quaid|dennis haysbert|patricia clarkson|viola davis|james rebhorn"

"far_from_heaven","'Far From Heaven' only speaks in sweeping symphonies, cherry red Technicolor, and postcard optimism - it is gargantuan in its emotion, pleasing in its artifice. To say it is an homage to Douglas Sirk and his 1950s soap operatic conglomerates would be an understatement: though released in 2002, it is so authentic in its nuclear family-meets-trouble melodrama one could swear it were released in 1957 if it starred Jane Wyman instead of the inimitable Julianne Moore.  The latter, putting on her most happily repressed face, headlines as Cathy Whitaker, an archetypal wholesome homemaker who seemingly has the perfect life. Her husband, Frank (Dennis Quaid), is the successful owner of a TV company, her children shining examples of the 'Aw, shucks!' cliché. The family, unquestionably, leads their wealthy social circle, housewives looking up to Cathy like she's a real-life Donna Reed, husbands thoroughly jealous of Frank's marital good luck.  But things aren't as enviably flawless as they first appear. Though they've been happily married for years, Frank is becoming increasingly tortured by his hidden homosexuality - he's been able to keep it locked inside for his entire life, but as the film opens, he's wearing down. It doesn't take long before he visits a gay bar, before Cathy stops by his office late one night to bring him dinner and discovers him kissing another man. With her seamless personal life crumbling before her very eyes, Cathy is surprised to find herself progressively attracted to her gardener, Raymond (Dennis Haysbert), a black man committed to such a crushing job because the harmful segregation of the decade hardly allows for him to use his business degree in the real world. While most of the predominantly white town prefers to pretend that he doesn't exist, Cathy is infatuated by his charming eloquence - he presents her with a point of view completely foreign to her. As her marriage races to its last legs and the town begins viciously talking, Cathy is forced to consider whether pursuing such a controversial relationship is worth risking her seemingly invincible reputation. Todd Haynes isn't interested in making a new kind of 1950s melodrama; though he stirs in taboos aplenty (you can't release a film in 2002 and expect the usual vintage subtleties to work efficiently), every aspect is astonishing in its well-versed mimicry. Purposefully, the sets look like sets; the music, massively melodic and dramatic, speaks for the characters when manners forbid them to divulge their true feelings; the color palette, specifically planned by Haynes during the conceptual process (green and black are used during scenes of anxiety, vibrant autumn colors spread about throughout moments of clarity), is breathtakingly identical to the Technicolor pigmentation of the filmmaking era. One could watch the film simply for its emotional content; but for cinephiles with a fetish for Douglas Sirk, it's a goldmine of pitch-perfect homage.  Its complete lack of irony and subtlety makes the photographic lust pop, its storyline, its acting, ripple through the body - there's a reason why 'Written on the Wind' and 'Imitation of Life' are such classics: the over-the-top, chintzy dramatizations are just too cinematic to resist on a sympathetic level. Haynes's remarkable dedication to stock dialogue allows for the underlying emotional context to sizzle; as Cathy inserts pet-names and breathy coos in-between each word for the sake of appearing like she's the perfect wife, we can increasingly see that it's all part of a façade that conceals her inner intricacies, which, during most of them film, are being torn apart. By never getting to express her dissatisfaction through dialogue, Moore's performance is heightened, Haynes's screenplay all the more deceivingly complex.  It touches on the social issues of the 1950s (race most predominantly, homosexuality at a close second) with gusto films of the decade were not allowed to discuss, and yet 'Far From Heaven' never feels like a modernization. It, instead, is an expansion of the artistic and cerebral ideas of the luscious subgenre. Moore is fantastic as a woman perhaps more real than Dorothy Malone or Lana Turner ever were; Haysbert and Quaid are excellent as the men she holds close to her heart but only lead her to nowhere. No matter where she turns, Cathy Whitaker will never be content. But her film long predicament is compulsively watchable, and as long as her life is lensed as if it were a part of an unusually decadent Photoplay session, that's good enough for me.","45","Drama, Romance","julianne moore|dennis quaid|dennis haysbert|patricia clarkson|viola davis|james rebhorn"

"far_from_heaven","Suburbia is a subject that has been tackled in numerous novels and films over the decades, and most of them have the same general message that the inhabitants of suburbia, despite the happiness on the surface, are actually troubled people. FAR FROM HEAVEN is really no different in that regard. It is a period piece set in 1950's New Hampshire, and revolves around a (supposedly) happy married couple played by Julianne Moore and Dennis Quaid. To avoid any plot specifics I'll just say that the film deals with issues of racism and homosexuality through the lens and attitudes of 1950's America. It is also directed by Todd Haynes, well known for his other films with deal with gay culture and issues. Even though this is the first film I've seen by him, I would imagine that this film is very toned down from he did previously, given the PG-13 rating. One thing the film does really well is take a well-worn topic, but treat it with such dead-face sincerity that is almost comes off as a parody. Yet, this film really isn't that funny. In fact, it provoked little emotional response out of me in general other than the occasional bemused chuckle. While some might count this as a negative, I don't necessarily see it that way because I feel like this film's goal is to emulate a style of film and filmmaking rather than to comment on it in a postmodern way. The style of film I believe this film takes its cues from is the 1950's melodrama, e.g., PEYTON PLACE. Todd Haynes really showed an affection for this era in the overall design and look of the film, which has this idyllic quality to it. The production design, sets, costumes, etc. were all stylized in such a way that it made me feel like I was watching a film from the 1950's. Even the acting and line delivery was ever so slightly stilted to give off such a vibe. However, the one element that brought everything together was the beautiful score by Elmer Bernstein which lent an air of longing and yearning that complemented the film's thematic concerns quite nicely. Overall, FAR FROM HEAVEN doesn't have a unique story and the fact that it doesn't have much below the surface while at the same time portraying a milieu famous for being shallow is kind of ironic. Still, it is lovingly crafted and features some fine performances from its cast.","35","Drama, Romance","julianne moore|dennis quaid|dennis haysbert|patricia clarkson|viola davis|james rebhorn"
"far_from_heaven","To the outside world, the Whitakers have a perfect 1950s American home-life. Frank is a successful local businessman while, wife, Cathy is the quintessential mother and housewife, spending her days preparing for parties and tending to the needs of her family. However, this fragile veneer is shattered one night when Cathy discovers her husband has a secret life that becomes an irresistible compulsion. This movie is a closely observed character study of a woman who's life is irreversibly shaken and it is beautifully done. The whole story is played out against the backdrop of the prejudices of the time and, despite this in many ways being a slight tale, it is also a profound one. Cathy's friends, all society ladies, show their cruelty and shallowness as the whispers are passed around the community as the plot unfolds and she is wrongly accused of breaking the taboos prevalent at the time. Julianne Moore gives a perfect performance as Cathy, making dialogue that could seem stilted and false come alive with deeper meaning. Dennis Quaid plays the part of Frank with enough vulnerability but isn't really given enough to do to make his predicament truly deserving of sympathy. The strongest male lead is taken by Dennis Haysbert who plays the intelligent, gentle Raymond, the gardener who strikes up a friendship with Cathy. The whole movie looks stunning with the autumnal colours of Connecticut forming a background that almost becomes a character in itself to the on-screen action. 1950s American has seldom looked more ravishing or been so sinister as it is here and director Todd Haynes is to be congratulated for that. Where I feel that the film does fall down slightly is that at the ending, I really felt there was so much more to be told about the lives of the three main protagonists and so was left feeling a little cheated by the way things hang in the air.","40","Drama, Romance","julianne moore|dennis quaid|dennis haysbert|patricia clarkson|viola davis|james rebhorn"

"far_from_heaven","There were so many things about this film that I loved--the costumes, the color palettes, the cinematography, the music, the look of the 50s, when I was a child. However, the fifties was heavily into melodrama as well. Julianna Moore's Kathy Whitaker and her husband are such a fake Stepford couple. When people's lives are coming unravelled, nobody is so unfailingly knd and considerate and perfect. There are fights and yelling. Even in the most crucial scenes of conflict here, the people involved are so understated as to be almost comatose. It's as if everyone is heavily sedated on tranquilizers, and it definitely does not reflect real life, in the 50s or any other era. I wasn't moved to tears at all, because, since the film did not reflect real life, it didn't touch any chords with real people. It never rose above it's own world that was purely artifice.","30","Drama, Romance","julianne moore|dennis quaid|dennis haysbert|patricia clarkson|viola davis|james rebhorn"
"far_from_heaven","Todd Haynes' homage to the films of Douglas Sirk lovingly recreates the 1950s bourgeois milieu (where social norms and pressures to fit in and be perfect dominate) that Sirk probed in so many great films (All that Heaven Allows, Imitation of Life, Written on the Wind). However, he brings some of the subterranean conflicts and desires that Sirk only hinted at to the surface and makes them overt and this both increases the melodrama and reduces the shock that Sirk provides through a lighter touch. But that's not to say that the jostling surface and inner realities that Haynes portrays aren't fascinating too. Julianne Moore and Dennis Quaid play a married couple who are models of their community ... until he confronts his homosexuality and she falls in love with their Black gardener (played with great warmth by Dennis Haysbert, echoing Rock Hudson in All That Heaven Allows and with a tip of the hat to Fassbinder). If you love Sirk, you'll love this.","40","Drama, Romance","julianne moore|dennis quaid|dennis haysbert|patricia clarkson|viola davis|james rebhorn"

"far_from_heaven","The story itself is fabulous. The glorious colors reflect the bold, primary-colors used by Douglas Sirk. The use of such bold colors contrasts (intentionally) with the murky moral views which, although ostensibly reasonable, simply put a deceptive smile over racial relations and diversity that are little different than those in the South except for the smile. Without giving away too much, the American dream unravels in glorious, scabrous fashion. The acting, particularly from Moore and Clarkson is of an astonishing caliber and Quaid is not far behind, if at all. A parable indeed about the Danger of the Status Quo, but also a tribute to Sirk films in its treatment of important social issues. Not many outside Todd Haynes, who has worked fabulously in Safe with Moore and other films concerned with commenting on social issues, could make a film that reveals so beautifully the dark side of the suburban idyll.","45","Drama, Romance","julianne moore|dennis quaid|dennis haysbert|patricia clarkson|viola davis|james rebhorn"

"far_from_heaven","Right away you question what intent instinct is when you assume the husband is cheating...on a woman and not a man. This is a movie that shows the true nature of the American people back in the 60's and the ignorance that followed. One great example was when the mother asked the black maid who was the black girl who got hurt...now most wouldn't have got the fact that this is so wrong. What? All black people have a secret code and know everything about everyone. It's quite funny. The propaganda of showing the arrogance and hatred of blacks was fantastic.

"far_from_heaven","More like an episode of 'Mad Men', Todd Haynes' period piece drama 'Far From Heaven' tackles some racy issues including homosexuality in the late '50s, interracial relationships, and divorce, all on the backdrop of a picture perfect '50s family. Julianne Moore plays the matriarch of the family, Cathy Whitaker, a stay-at-home mom with more on her plate than the average professional. Between magazine interviews, party planning, and keeping the household in order, Cathy barely has enough time to gossip with her fellow stay-at-home wives, including Eleonor (Patricia Clarkson). Her drifting husband, Frank (Dennis Quaid) is kept away from the home by work, or so he would have her think. A late night dinner run to the office to see her husband proves harmful when the truth surfaces of why he actually stays late at work. Add to that the blossoming relationship between herself and her black gardener Raymond (Dennis Haysbert) and the film is a muddle of a gossiper's delight. Moore steals the show with her reserved nature, powering through the heavy portions of the film, putting the entire cast of 'Mad Men' to shame. However, Quaid and Haysbert never quite bring to the table the same level of awe. And Viola Davis shows her uncanny nature as a maid almost a decade before 'The Help'. 'Far From Heaven' never quite answers a majority of its questions and really does come off like an episode of a television show, but with enough star power and 'before its time' content, the film holds together well enough to captivate.","30","Drama, Romance","julianne moore|dennis quaid|dennis haysbert|patricia clarkson|viola davis|james rebhorn"

"far_from_heaven","'Save me from this prison, Lord, help me get away, 'cause only you can save me now from this misery, 'cause I've been lost in my own place, and I'm gettin' weary; how far is Heaven?' I'm so, so, so sorry, I'm not even crazy about that song, it's just that I'm watching this film after that song - which is two years younger - was released, so I just could not help myself. Besides, Chicano rock is kind of fitting, because as much as this film is driven by themes dealing with race, gender, sexual orientation and class, we may as well slap in a Mexican ethnicity for good measure. Music should be a major theme also because this stylish period drama about gays' problems, women's problems and Julianne Moore's problems is in more-or-less ever other way the definitive Todd Haynes film, except it actually made its budget back. Huh, and Russell Crowe didn't join this project because he thought that it would be too low-profile, but lo and behold, his bold statement was challenged by this film's shockingly exceeding its outrageous of... $13.5 million. Shoot, I joke, but 'Velvet Goldmine' didn't cost but $9 million and didn't even make it to $2 million at the box office, but that was 1998, and this is the 21st century (2001 mind you, but the 21st century nonetheless), where the struggles of the homosexuals are respected enough for us to sit down and embrace film that outline the depths of their hard live... as well as the hard lives of the blacks and women who we keep kissing up to. This is a film for liberals, to be sure, but hey, my conservative self liked it, and yet, it's 'far from heaven...ly' (Tee-hee), and for several reasons.  This is certainly a pretty modernist film, but Todd Haynes makes the nifty stylistic choice of marrying contemporary filmmaking sensibilities with sensibilities of films from the late-'50s era in which this drama takes place, and such a move is unique and often effective, but the dark, dirty secret in the film industry is that they weren't exactly making terribly sharp decisions back in the day when it came to filmmaking, so when this effort does anything from presenting distancingly near-amateur fade transitions or overplaying the colorful score, it's hard not to be thrown off, especially when the modern filmmaking sensibilities work their way back in, and not all that organically. The film is kind of uneven in its storytelling style, juggling contemporary and old-fashioned filmmaking sensibilities with off-putting assurance issues that go matched in severity only by inconsistencies in the story itself. It's hard not to appreciate this film's thematic depth, as it is uniquely handled and worthy, but quite frankly, this drama does indeed get pretty carried away with its being packed with so many themes and plot layers, to the point of feeling overblown, or at least as though it has trouble juggling all of its key elements without evading focal unevenness. The film gets to be excessive and inconsistent in its layered storytelling and struggle to flesh out as much as it can, and yet, no matter how much this film wears itself out with depth, there's still something kind of undercooked-feeling about it, as immediate development is lacking, and attention to full dramatic depth has its limited areas, yet there is still more time than there should be that is dedicated to the aforementioned excess material. Haynes will carry this film a long way in a lot of places, and then he'll end up making some questionable move that holds things back, so don't go in expecting this effort to be as realized as something like 'I'm Not There' or something, no matter how much it may feel like Haynes wants to carry this vision to that level, due to a palpable sense of ambition that reflects the areas in which Haynes falls short. This is a rewarding drama, but it's not what it could have been, nor is it what Haynes wants it to be, even though he tries so hard to bring effectiveness through the questionable stylistic choices, excessive thematic depth and, in some ways, subtle storytelling that ironically end up holding back Haynes' vision. Nonetheless, Haynes' keeps the film going more than he holds it back, crafting an ultimately very compelling and lavish drama, but not without the help of some fine artistic collaborators.  A bona fide legend in film scoring if there ever was one, the now-late, great Elmer Bernstein was among the definitive film score composers of the 1950s, thus, back in 2002, Todd Haynes summoned Bernstein to this project to compose what would end up being his final score, and by extension, quite the capper to a legendary career, because even though Haynes' plays with the atmosphere of Bernstein's efforts are occasionally cloying, Bernstein's unique and beautiful marriage of subtle modern tastes and good-old fashioned color is both musically outstanding and about as complimentary to the selling of this era as Peter Rogness' art direction. This wouldn't exactly be an effective 1950s homage if the art department didn't put its all into reviving this distinguished era as lavishly as he can, thus Rogness pumps a lot of inspiration into his leading an inspired design team, highlighted by production designer Mark Friedberg and costume designer Sandy Powell, both of whom deliver on mesmerizingly intricate designs that, on top of being immersive, captivate with a loveliness that goes complimented by Edward Lachman's lushly colored and warmly lit cinematography. Visually arresting and musically delightful, this film excels from a stylistic standpoint so much that if you see this effort for no other reason, see it to marvel at its artistic integrity, but don't go in expecting this film to only have artistry going for it, because when it comes to substance, praise is also due, if limited. As I've been saying, storytelling gets to be problematic, whether when it's getting to be uneven in its narrative style, or when it's getting to be overblown with its thematic depth and dramatic layers, but where this story concept could have really thinned out its weight, or even slipped into conventionalism, this compelling narrative, even in concept, is unique and complex on both a thematic level and dramatic level, with worthy messages and a very human core that go brought to life in inspired storytelling. Todd Haynes' score may get to be overblown and uneven, but where this very boastful thematic drama could have gone the way of other dramas of its nature and collapsed into glaring subtlety issues, there's a very sharp and controlled cleverness to Haynes' writing that keeps characterization about as well-rounded as it can be with limited expository depth, and it itself is brought to life by genuine highlights in Haynes' direction, whose heart may get to be too ambitious for you to not notice the shortcomings in this efforts' struggle for excellence, but carries a flavorful thoughtfulness that keeps entertainment value consistent, until broken up by genuine emotional resonance whose effectiveness ranges from gripping to moving. Haynes' inspired offscreen performance as both writer and director builds a very endearing human drama, but what truly brings this character study to life is the onscreen talent, because if nothing else outside of style is consistently strong about this film, it's the performances, particularly those of the leads, with Dennis 'The Allstate Guy' Haysbert being thoroughly charismatic as an intellectual black man who challenges the judgment of society, while Dennis Quaid all but steals the show in his emotionally powerful portrayal of a married man who comes to discover dark depths about himself, and leading lady Julianne Moore carries the drama with an effortlessly layered portrayal of an upstanding woman of the community whose flaws and questionable decisions will threaten her with the scorn of her peers and the devastation of a fantasy life. In most every regard, this film is inspired, and that makes the final product's falling just short of considerable strength under the weight of unevenness and overambition all the more frustrating, but the fact of the matter is that there is a lot of heart in this film, and you can challenge such inspiration for only so long before compellingness gets through, entertaining, engaging and ultimately rewarding as a both modernist and old-fashioned drama.  In conclusion, the old-fashioned touches get to be questionable, and don't exactly organically gel with the more contemporaneous touches, as surely as the overwhelming amount of thematic depth and plot layers don't always elude unevenness, or, for that matter, expository limitations, and with these shortcomings going emphasized by a certain sense of ambition, the final product falls short of what it wants to be and perhaps could have been, but through a captivating artistic style that goes built on excellent score work by Elmer Bernstein, immersive art direction by Peter Rogness and lush cinematography by Edward Lachman, as well as through a unique and complex story that goes brought to life by thoughtful writing and direction, and compelling performances, - particularly those by Dennis Haysbert, Dennis Quaid and Julianne Moore - Todd Haynes' 'Far From Heaven' is left to stand as an entertaining, when not thoroughly engaging and modern interpretation of questionable relationships during a less modern era.  3/5 - Good","40","Drama, Romance","julianne moore|dennis quaid|dennis haysbert|patricia clarkson|viola davis|james rebhorn"

"far_from_heaven","'Far From Heaven' could be considered to be an 'experimental' film, to be truthful. It is a study and a replica of the great America melodramas of the 1950s, which is the time period the film is set in. Hayes, the director, has clearly done that intentionally, basically pretending that his film was made in the 1950s. With an excellent screenplay touching upon the ever-relevant issues of racism and homosexuality, the story is rather unpredictable and extremely engaging. The cinematography is absolutely phenomenal, which works exquisitely with the stunning art direction and costume design. Visually, the film is simply beautiful - possibly one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. The acting, as well, is superb, especially the leading trio - Moore, Quaid and Haysbert. Julianne Moore is pitch-perfect in this role that has gained her even more critical acclaim than any other previous role. Quaid has a restrained, but effective performance, just as Haysbert does. One can criticise the film for being 'over the top' or 'fake' or on such grounds, but what it comes down to is that this film is an homage to the melodramas of the 1950s and is emulating the same. And the act is quite effective and convincing.

"far_from_heaven","the film is quite an intriguing one. I took this one out from the library and I had no idea what it was about other than the fact that it was a romance and that Peter Travers and Roger Ebert had given it rave reviews. when I started watching it, there were twist's and turns that caught me off guard. as I watched, I got a sense that it was not just focusing on one thing but several about being part of a group or race of people and being condemned for it. It's really a film about prejudice on sexuality and race. Julianne Moore's character for the film seems to be the witness of these two prejudices. as she befriends a black man in a time when you should not, she finds that she is not only shunned for her actions, but the family she befriended is attacked by it as well, causing her to leave the family alone. why? we don't know, is it because she is afraid that the family will be attacked some more or is it because she is fearing the fate of her own supposedly perfect life? when she finds out that her husband is secretly gay, she urges him to go through conversion therapy, however, she has no knowledge on the fact that this is also the actions of prejudice.

This film made sense in why each person joined this team and what they lost and had to gain in order to get into doing this sting.

They rob during the big restyling matches when security is distracted and more money is in the bank. Terry of all the people you know that There's always someone watching. The ending I found unsatisfied. I felt like the way it ended was abrupt and needed either a little more or needed to end somewhere else a little sooner with an explanation.

"confessions_of_a_dangerous_mind","With a talented cast and screenplay by Charlie Kaufman, based on an intriguing story, George Clooney's directorial debut had a lot of potential. Sadly somehow it adds up to slightly less than the sum of its parts. It's a decent movie, but not a great one. The tone of the film jerks between, cartoon quirkiness and darker, more serious musings about CIA assassinations. I'm sure that was intentional, but it doesn't quite work, and while the film seems like it has something serious to say, it's never quite clear what that is. That aside, there's plenty to like here. The film looks great and is cleverly directed throughout. The underrated Sam Rockwell is really good as the off-beat sleazy protagonist, and Clooney and Rutger Hauer are good in supporting roles as cloak and dagger types. Drew Barrymore and Julia Roberts do their best with what they are given, but their characters are not very well fleshed out, as is depressingly so often the case with roles for women. They also don't seem to age, despite the film taking place over a couple of decades. It may not be as clever as it wants to be, but it's definitely worth watch if you like Sam Rockwell.","30","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Comedy","sam rockwell|drew barrymore|george clooney|julia roberts|rutger hauer|maggie gyllenhaal"

"confessions_of_a_dangerous_mind","Chuck Barris, the host of the infamous Gong Show, wrote a book long ago in which he claims that he moonlighted as a CIA assassin overseas. Yeah, I call shenanigans. Knowing who Chuck is through glimpses of Gong Show reruns, and his apparent addiction to women, he seems like a full-blown sociopath. But man, what a story he tells. Hell, I'd make a movie out of it too if given the chance. Charlie Kaufman is the scribe to this interesting film, and we see a bright portion of his mad genius in quite a few sections of the film. The final scenes of the film really highlight his fantastic surrealism. Yet, the potential of his script gets squashed by it's director, George Clooney. The Hollywood golden-boy's first foray into directing a film, and he makes sure to gussy it up with as many celebrities as he can squeeze in, and an EXTREMELY overexposed image quality. This movie is desperate to be Kaufman, but is forced through the Clooney machine. So what we get, is a great idea, watered down. But out of the many problems the film has, the brightest spot of the whole thing, other than it's great script, is Sam Rockwell as Chuck Barris. He gives a nearly flawless portrayal of him. It's scary how uncanny he is to him.","35","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Comedy","sam rockwell|drew barrymore|george clooney|julia roberts|rutger hauer|maggie gyllenhaal"

It is truly not a feat that should be attempted without an extremely skilled and experienced director, yet Clooney succeeded none the less. In my experience, action-spy movies tend to be the only ones to succeed, and unfortunately seeing how this movie did in the box office, the statement stands. Overall, the film managed to make the audience care about its central character, leave a bit of thrill for the spy, a little spite for the unfaithful husband, a lot of soullessness for the host of your usual game show, and the remaining shred of humanity on a writer.

Starring Sam Rockwell, his performance envelopes the screen and the Barris persona. Liberties are taken, to be sure, but the heart of what the book was trying to get across was captured.

"confessions_of_a_dangerous_mind","Would you believe that Chuck Barris, the inventor of TV trash ('The Gong Show', 'The Newlywed Game'), pulled a Hannah Montana and also worked for the CIA? I didn't, and still don't. 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' doesn't feel like a biographical film, maybe because it's pretty artsy or maybe because we simply cannot believe what we're seeing. Barris, in his memoir of the same name, claims that he killed over 33 people for the Central Intelligence Agency. Many, of whom, became victims while he acted as a chaperone during his contestants' vacation prizes. It's a strange declaration coming from an eccentric man, and you assume that 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' will have the smart zaniness of 'Being John Malkovich' (which was also written by Charlie Kaufman.) But George Clooney, who makes his directional debut here, reportedly wanted Kaufman's script to be 'without corruption or softening,' which, in this case, is a bad move. Barris was apparently very involved during production of the film, adamant about making sure his story was told in the most truthful way. In most cases, having the real deals running laps behind the scenes can be a good thing, but 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' is a film that screams to be wacky - yet it instead goes on a downhill ride of increasing glumness that nearly kills all the fun. The film opens in 1981. Chuck Barris (Sam Rockwell) is holed up in a messy hotel room in the bad part of town, unshaven, clearly post-mental breakdown, and slightly agoraphobic. A woman knocks on the door begging for him to come out. He doesn't, making us wonder - what the heck happened here? Then, the film flashes back to the early '60s, before Barris was blamed for beginning the rise of TV garbage, brewing ideas for potential television shows while trying to stay on the rise. But right as Barris finally gets a deal on ABC, he is approached by Jim Byrd (George Clooney), a CIA agent who has been profiling Barris for months in hopes to recruit him as a covert operative. Barris agrees, intrigued by the lifestyle of a spy - but when he finds that Byrd is much shadier than he appears, murder goes from stylish to horrendous in seconds. As his career declines (both the public and critics tire of his low-class shows), so does his grip on reality. With a plot like this one, 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' sounds like a black comedy. A TV host who moonlights as an assassin? Perfect. But the film never seems to understand what tone it's going for. There are times where the film is light-hearted, rippling with energy and alive in its conversations, while others are so somber that the quirky mood is smothered to death. There are three kinds of scenes - ones that are spirited and funny (Barris and Penny's first-meeting, an unconventional meet-cute that is executed flawlessly), ones that have the dark mystery of a James Bond film (Patricia and Barris' introduction to each other is covered in shadows and quite tense), and ones that are so shrouded in sadness that we can hardly bare it (the entire final half). Each individual scene is masterfully shot, but they come together with the same kind of force a toddler puts on a puzzle piece that just won't fit. The cast is excellent, and Clooney has enviable chops when it comes to directing, but 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' has a personality disorder that can't seem to make up its dangerous, dangerous mind.","25","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Comedy","sam rockwell|drew barrymore|george clooney|julia roberts|rutger hauer|maggie gyllenhaal"
"confessions_of_a_dangerous_mind","His future was uncertain. His every move was being watched.Very Good Film! One of Charlie Kaufman's more overlooked and underrated screenplays, 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' may have been something of a departure from the high-concept experimentalism that made his previous brainchildren, 'Being John Malkovich' and 'Adaptation' (a masterpiece and a near-masterpiece, respectively) such striking breaths of fresh air, but on no account should its ability to engage and entertain on those strengths of its own be underestimated. Taking a well-earned break from the surreal situations and the complex plotting, Kaufman turned his attention here to a much more straightforward yarn that was better grounded in reality; the twist there being that it was based on a story that, while allegedly true, just as likely never happened. 'Confessions' though is willing to give Chuck Barris the benefit of the doubt in regards to his dubious claims to have been a secret assassin for the CIA in the midst of his days as a game show host, giving life to such controversial classic as 'the Gong Show' and 'the Dating Game' while taking it from a range of human targets around the globe. It sits back and lets the scenario unfold without question - and does so with such considerable spirit and vigour that it's hard not to get lured in and pulled along for the ride. Regardless of whether the real-life Barris truly did have some incredible adventures within his time, or simply an overly-active imagination, this ×movie translates it into one heck of an enjoyable romp - slick, stylish and entrancing on the surface, and with a bracingly poignant and sobering tale lurking underneath. It's not an innovative, far-out, one-of-a-kind experience (a la 'Being John Malkovich'). But it's an entertaining, well-made and entirely satisfying flick with one particularly brilliant stand-out performance, and that's more than enough to do the job. Kaufman can probably pen avant-garde better than anybody else today, but 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' goes to prove that, when in the right company, he can write 'normal' just as impressively.Television made him famous, but his biggest hits happened off screen. 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' is the story of a legendary showman's double life - television producer by day, CIA assassin by night. At the height of his TV career, Chuck Barris was recruited by the CIA and trained to become a covert operative. Or so Barris said.","30","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Comedy","sam rockwell|drew barrymore|george clooney|julia roberts|rutger hauer|maggie gyllenhaal"

"1200661_informant?","'The Informant!' has plenty of twists and turns that will leave you completely surprised and laughing hysterically. It's one of those true stories that's so insane it has to be true, if only because no writer would have the guts to create a tale with so many ups and downs and manic developments for our main character. It has a lot of great performances, particularly from Matt Damon and it's a smart film that knows your comedy doesn't need to go for the easy route to get some genuine laughs. The comedy comes from the dialogue and the situations that our hero gets himself in, no people getting hit on the head with hammers or getting caught in compromising situations after a night of binge drinking. If that's what you're prepared to see, you'll have a great time. It's suspenseful and hilarious so you better be prepared to dedicate some time after the film to look up the true story just so you can find out even more about Mark Whitacre and all the other people involved.

"1200661_informant?","Whatever reasons there are to watch The Informant! are overshadowed by the fact that I was simply willing to watch anything directed by Steven Soderbergh. The Informant! sees director Steven Soderbergh returning to the territory of making a biopic about a whistleblower after his last effort of doing so on the Academy Award winning biopic Erin Brockovich. But instead of taking a solely dramatic angle on the film, Steven Soderbergh decides to give a really light-hearted mood to The Informant! while maintaining the dramatic nature of the story so that it finds an interesting balance between comedy and drama. Although the film itself is not the most consistently interesting, the approach that Steven Soderbergh takes does manage to ensure that the film transcends the generic style of filmmaking in the usual formula of such a film. The final product is half decent, but Steven Soderbergh's role as director is one of the best aspects of the film simply because he puts a special kind of twist on the film. The Informant! doesn't live up to Erin Brockovich because it just isn't as inspiring or meaningful. I mean, the two stories are very different and the films follow different styles, but the fact that Steven Soderbergh made both of them left them open to comparison. Both films have their own positive elements such as good acting, but Erin Brockovich is a lot more deep and has firm social commentary whereas The Informant! is more of a talkative film. Erin Brockovich was about the titular woman as well as her involvement in the legal system, whereas The Informant! is less focused on the former and essentially solely dedicated to the latter which means that it is a very talkative film and seems more theoretical than human. The problem is that it doesn't emphasise the people in the film and more just the story itself, even though it does touch upon Mark Whitacre a decent amount. I guess what I'm saying is that The Informant! lacks depth and attempts to make up for it with an innovative style, but there is only so far that it can actually go which means that the story is not always interesting and has a tendency to drag on for extended periods of time at certain moments in the film. A lot of The Informant! is a drag and it isn't consistent as a comedy or drama and comes up short in terms of laughs and effective dramatic themes, so it is a bit of a mixed quality film.But as a whole, The Informant! was still worth a viewing. While it was imperfect, Steven Soderberg's energetic direction on the film gives it the treatment that it needs to stand out from the crowd. While its story is not too great, the actual storytelling is good because Steven Soderbergh's stylish direction gives it a certain kind of amiable charm. The cinematography is good and reflects an earlier time period in cinema which gives The Informant! the feeling of age that it really needs to have a genuine sense of legitimacy. The cinematography in the film is reminiscent of a classical film style, as is the musical score which gives it the humourous edge of a Charlie Chaplin film and makes the experience more enjoyable. The style is the one thing that makes The Informant! enough to actually stand out from a crowd, and for that aspect mostly it is an enjoyable film. Of course, the cast also do their part to ensure that the film is good.Matt Damon is a terrific casting choice for the lead role of Mark Whitacre because he captures the correct level of neuroticism for the character in a sense which is both humourous and dramatic and remains consistently interesting, all the while he works on creating a character that viewers genuinely sympathise for. He manages to step away from the standard and stereotypical Matt Damon performance that viewers have come to expect from him through small means, such as the fact that his costume alters his look to have him seem a lot like someone else as well as the sense that he is not an overconfident or ridiculously heroic figure. Although The Informant! does not have all that much of a human side to it, the amount of effort that Matt Damon puts into his performance manages to come off successfully from both a comedic and dramatic perspective which has viewers supporting his actions and laughing at some of his small anecdotes as well. Matt Damon steps into his role well and delivers another successful performance which works as a dramatic role and has a decent comic edge to it at the same tine which ends up ensuring that he carries the film to the end by delivering his lines with realism and dedication to character. Melanie Lynskey also makes a very genial presence. Although I'm sort of a sucker for her because of her role as Rose on Two and a Half Men which was always a sweet and likable character despite actually being a sociopath, and she brings some of her natural charm over into The Informant! by using it to create a chemistry with Matt Damon which has a feel of reality to it and gives the film a more genuine edge. The Informant gains quite a bit of benefit simply from the presence of Melanie Lynskey, and her delightful line delivery is very enjoyable which ensures that she ends up giving a nice performance and that she is one of the most memorable aspects ot The Informant! in my personal opinion.Joel McHale and Patton Oswalt also give good supporting efforts to The Informant! of their own right.But despite the talents of the cast and the innovative style of filmmaking that Steven Soderbergh gives to The Informant! as director, the story is simply too talkative and lacking in depth to feel humane or inspiring and does not match up to his similarly themed prior film, Erin Brockovich.","25","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Comedy","matt damon|scott bakula|joel mchale|melanie lynskey|thomas f. wilson|tony hale"

The main character is a chronic liar, the movie even states of how difficult it is to figure out when he is telling the truth.The cinematographer does his best to make the film visually interesting as possible, but that only goes so far.","20","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Comedy","matt damon|scott bakula|joel mchale|melanie lynskey|thomas f. wilson|tony hale"

"burn_after_reading","I had a simply delightful time with this wacky comedy. It was nice going in without knowing what to expect because I didn't have any idea what was coming next. It was fun to uncover who was doing what and why as I watched the film. This did force me to watch more closely so I sometimes put more serious thought into it instead of just laughing along. I think I might like it even more on a rewatch because I will be able to relax and enjoy the humorous ride, knowing the main plot points. The performances were all great, but Brad Pitt stood out because he was so over the top. Frances McDormand was hilarious, and her matter-of-fact delivery made it all seem weirdly realistic despite the nuttiness of everything that was happening. But my favorite scenes by far were the couple of scenes with JK Simmons. He presented such a great range that perfectly summed up all that had come before. It was awesome having those moments where everything is explained, but then I had the realization that it sounds ridiculous to an outsider (like Simmons' character) who doesn't know how it all started.The setup in the first act was probably the weakest part of the film for me. While I appreciated all the back story so that I could comprehend what was going on, it took so long for the different character stories to intersect that I wondered if it was ever coming. The second act is where things escalate for all the characters and stories start to collide. I thought the humor really picked up here and it didn't let up until the very end. I have a sneaking suspicion that, with a few more views, this could easily become my favorite Coen comedy.","40","Drama, Comedy","george clooney|frances mcdormand|john malkovich|brad pitt|tilda swinton|richard jenkins"

"burn_after_reading","'Burn After Reading' is one of my least favorite Coen Brothers films. The Coens have created some inspired work from 'Fargo' to 'No Country For Old Men,' but this script relies on a constant stream of f-words to fill in the gaps left by its weak plot. I loathe modern comedies that subscribe to the belief that if you use the f-word enough, it will become a running gag (Melissa McCarthy, I'm talking to you). In fact, the main theme that connects the film together is its crude content. Why is every relationship in the film predicated on infidelity? And that machine that George Clooney builds - there is absolutely no purpose behind it, and yet it's there for the sake of being there. I didn't like this film when it came out and tried to approach it with fresh eyes, believing that I would fall in love with it knowing what I know now about movies. I was wrong and should have trusted my first experience with it. I actually hated it significantly more than I did the first time! You would think that a cast including John Malkovich, Brad Pitt, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton (detestable in this role), Richard Jenkins, J.K. Simmons, and Clooney would have to be amazing but the entire story is absurd. It's almost as if they pigeonholed a bunch of great actors into a 90's Adam Sandler movie and called it sophisticated. Black comedies often miss the mark because they don't find that balance between feeling sorry for characters and enjoying their misfortune. This one is a prime example. Pitt is the only reason to even consider watching this film a his character is so over the top that we love to see him be absurd. Unfortunately, the rest of the characters are so static that he feels out of place. There are a few decent moments in this film (serving the papers, Pitt's nosebleed) but nothing that will make it worth enduring. If you love the Coen brothers, you might see something in 'Burn After Reading' that I didn't. After you're done, you can find me pouting in the corner, still annoyed with myself for wasting an hour and a half on this film AGAIN!","10","Drama, Comedy","george clooney|frances mcdormand|john malkovich|brad pitt|tilda swinton|richard jenkins"

"burn_after_reading","In their latest movie, the Coen Brothers write and direct an all-star cast who play some of the most outlandish characters. Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich) who is recently fired from the CIA decides he will write a memoir of his experience, much to the dissatisfaction of his wife (Tilda Swinton). Meanwhile at the gym, Chad (Brad Pitt) and Linda (Frances McDormand) find a CD that contains sensitive government material. However, instead of returning it to Cox who they think it belongs to, they decide to hold it ransom for a reward. Not only is Cox confused on how this could have happened, his wife is also having an affair with a man named Harry (George Clooney) who is additionally also sleeping with Linda. That leads Harry to connect the dots between the characters in this funny, dark comedy.'Burn After Reading' contains many twists and it leaves the audience quite confused which is fitting because the characters are equally as confused. All the characters have their flaws which are all conveniently shown at once, but still remain endearing. Without the specific character aspects, there would have been hardly any depth to the plot and in turn wouldn't have made for much of an entertaining film. It's a noble attempt at a comedic film for the Coen brothers, but it's not their best by far. With a confusing plot line, it is best that you watch 'Burn After Reading' more than once, for subsequent viewings might expose some of the story's deeper details.","35","Drama, Comedy","george clooney|frances mcdormand|john malkovich|brad pitt|tilda swinton|richard jenkins"

"burn_after_reading","The Coen Brothers write and direct an all-star cast in their latest movie Burn After Reading. John Malkovich is Osbourne Cox who is recently fired from the CIA. He decides to go home and tell his wife he quit and wants to work on his memoirs, much to his wife's (Tilda Swinton) dismay. Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand are Chad Feldheimer and Linda Litzke, two gym employees that come across a CD that contains sensitive government material. Their boss Ted (Richard Jenkins) tells them to get rid of the material, but instead they attempt to blackmail Osbourne who believes they is the owner of the material. Osbourne is confused and believes they simply have the working progress of his memoirs. Into the mix is Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney) who is a womanizer that is sleeping with Osbourne's wife, and Linda. He connects the characters in what becomes a funny comedy. The head of the CIA (J.K. Simmons) is monitoring the story, and the various characters scheme, plot, blackmail and even kill each other in what becomes one of their most confusing cases to date. He is told about each of the segments of the movie in a recap moment, which helps catch the audience up and realize how comedic some of what the audience just saw really is. The plot is similar to The Big Lebowski where you are not sure where the story will turn next, or who will be the next to meet their untimely demise. The audience is left as confused as the characters in the story. Each of the characters is flawed in some way, but they are still endearing to the audience in some way. Chad is clueless, naïve, but optimistic. Linda has little self-worth and believes copious surgery will vastly improve her image. Osbourne is an alcoholic who has sever temper tantrums. Harry is a womanizer who wants to have his cake and eat it too. Ted is too kind and unable tell how he feels about Linda. These character aspects give each of the characters a sense of depth that makes the story much more intriguing when something happens. The plot is confusing at times, and the film warrants a second viewing to really pick up on some of the stories intricacies. Burn After Reading is one of the Coen's brothers best comedic efforts for a film. At times it feels like it has too many characters to pick up for some of the plot elements, but it all comes together in the end. It is not as well rounded and likable as the Big Lebowski or the black comedy Fargo, but is far superior to their other films such as Lady Killers and Intolerable Cruelty. -10.08.2016","35","Drama, Comedy","george clooney|frances mcdormand|john malkovich|brad pitt|tilda swinton|richard jenkins"
"burn_after_reading","By now it is a well known fact that I find the Coen Brothers to be excessively overrated. I've slogged through Fargo, The Big Lebowski, O Brother, Where Art Thou?, Inside Llewyn Davis, No Country For Old Men and others while still failing to really grasp why the Coen Brothers get such a fantastic rap. Culturally their movie titles come up often and certain aspects of their middle American focus have become more popular and certainly the sepia overtones of O Brother, Where Art Thou? have become an important benchmark but overall, I still can't seem to find an impact that even begins to rival that of Lucas, Kubrick, Spielberg, Scott, Scorsese or Tarantino, despite the brothers often occupying the same space as these great directors (and sometimes winning awards over them as well). Burn After Reading has been next on my Coen Brothers filmography road trip and after seeing it, I have to say it may be my favorite of their films. That isn't to say it was fantastic. While the plot and timing came together better than their other films and the characters were infinitely more fascinating, Burn After Reading bears some similarities to Hail, Caesar! in that it continues to appear as a vanity project for Hollywood elite. While I like the cast and appreciate their stories a bit more, the brothers don't even make an attempt to disguise zoom shots on George Clooney and others that seem to serve no purpose other than to allow these high class thespians to showcase their fantastic and profound line delivery and acting skills during one of the movie's many monologues. In some ways, it continues to seem like, that in their attempt to highlight incredible performances, the brothers actually make a mockery of just that. Maybe that has always been the intention but it comes off as incredibly pretentious and off putting. Nevertheless, more than any of their other films that I have seen, Burn After Reading actually seems to latch on to both a coherent plot and a unifying philosophical identity. Aging seems to be the target here as all of the main characters struggle to come to terms with the disappearance of their youth. Clooney is obsessively exercise oriented even as he courts droves of women. Malkovich is paranoid and delusional about the importance of his life's work. Swinton desperately craves a change of scenery while McDormand plans to literally change her appearance to that of a younger woman. Brad Pitt has the most iconic performance, as the gym bro who opts for the ignorance is bliss approach as the youngest character on screen. It all goes down rather smoothly, even if it isn't as funny or profound as it could have been. Despite once again working with an A+ cast, the brothers still can't seem to distill the purest form of what their working with but Burn After Reading still seems like a high note for their filmography.","30","Drama, Comedy","george clooney|frances mcdormand|john malkovich|brad pitt|tilda swinton|richard jenkins"

"burn_after_reading","The Coens are my favorite. So after a disk containing a CIA agent's memoirs gets left on the floor of a gym locker room, it falls into the hands of two employees (Frances McDormand, Brad Pitt). They think they have stumbled upon something worthwhile, so they make a play to blackmail the agent (John Malkovich), not realizing the disk they have isn't really worth anything. Now if you were to pose me with the question of who my favorite director is, you probably already know that this is a difficult question to field for anybody who considers themselves to be versed in the medium. It's a tight contest, but I would personally give the slightest edge to the Coen brothers over Quentin Tarantino. They are just such versatile filmmakers, and they can make some of the tensest thrillers out there or make you keel over laughing with hilariously written quirky characters. I don't just like the majority of their projects, I love and admire them, and even one of their lesser, rompier movies like Burn After Reading hits home with me in ways that are difficult to describe. Now this was clearly an inspiration behind one of my favorite role-playing games: Fiasco. (if you're into that kind of thing and consider yourself to be a fan of this movie, I highly recommend it). Just like the game, the established framework is fantastic: everybody has these sordid and selfish motivations, there are no clear cut winners, and everybody kind of loses together. It is a bit on the cartoonish-side, but in a good way, and the chemistry is just right to lead to some fireworks whenever these characters happen to cross paths. And the dialogue is (as it always is with the Coens) skillfully penned and masterfully brought to life. They just know how to turn a phrase and make it so every important detail has the right amount of attention drawn to it and every punchline hits. It appeals to me so much, and I get a lot out of it. And the opening scene to this sets the tone so perfectly for what this movie is all about, courtesy of a highly animated John Malkovich. I adore the way the Coen brothers put together films; I always have and probably always will. I do understand that not all of their films are for everybody (some may have a problem watching a movie that's about low-intelligent characters), but practically all of their movies are for me. They possess the ability to make me laugh like no other, and I celebrate their entire library. For me, I feel this is totally a five star movie, and I don't think this is even close to being at the very top of their library, which should give you an indication of just how highly I think about them.","50","Drama, Comedy","george clooney|frances mcdormand|john malkovich|brad pitt|tilda swinton|richard jenkins"

"burn_after_reading","I forgot I was at a Coen Brother's movie until one of the characters (I won't say who) got shot in the face.  John Malkovich has a drinking problem.  Of course to the Mormons everyone has a drinking problem.  One of the best lines of the flick.  In summation everyone is sleeping with everyone else.  This is explained to JK Simmons.  He also says something to the effect of 'let me know when this makes sense.'  His role in the film is tiny but he has the most profound statements.  He describes the events of the film as a 'clusterfuck.'  I'm sure you know that the lot of this movie revolves around CIA files but the massive fornication plays a role too.  Amid all this there are two trips to Dermot Mulroney's new flick Coming Up Daisy.  This film, of course, doesn't actually exist but it makes for one hilarious cameo.  The flick is funny don't get me wrong but it's still a Coen Brothers flick so it's full of WTF!  And sadly this review is jumbled, just like the movie.  This movie easily reminded me why I love Brad Pitt.  I think the man can be typecast as your hot action hero type (much like his wife, they are a hot action hero family) but this movie reminds you once again of the man's range (see12 Monkeys, that's Pitt's Oscar nominated role FYI).  In Burn After Reading Brad Pitt's Chad is a music loving gym nut who prefers to bike places.  Maybe you've seen his silly little dance in the trailer.  This type of character is why I love Brad Pitt.  Because he plays dreamboat well but in my opinion he plays nutter a little better.  Burn After Reading is funny don't get me wrong but plenty of audible gasps escaped my mouth.  So I guess if you like that OMG feeling with your laughter watch it.  In the end I leave it up to you.","25","Drama, Comedy","george clooney|frances mcdormand|john malkovich|brad pitt|tilda swinton|richard jenkins"

"o_brother_where_art_thou","With O Brother Where Out Thou, It's not all that surprising that the soundtrack achieved more mainstream success than the film. As a total package the film is a series of near quaint sepia tinted vignettes with a certain 'ol' timey' vibe. More of a compilation of various themes and scenes than an actual film, the type of thing you would expect a collection of fragmented pieces of art from a time now past. Some would say this as a negative but I think it works great.Part Homer and part Twain, O Brother Where Out Thou follow a kind of dreamlike timeline. The film supposedly only takes place over a span of four days but events conspire that would have taken months, characters enter and leave the story without much effort or seeming relevance to the the larger plot, the plot ends at one point and then begins again. The nontraditional narrative structure works with the conflicting opinions presented within on things like religion, America, redemption, and the ever present Coen's theme of finding meaning in life amidst gods, devils, monsters (like a one eyed John Goodman), and seemingly aimless chaos. It's an American period piece that elevates itself beyond it's immediate reach with ease.","45","Drama, Comedy","george clooney|john turturro|tim blake nelson|john goodman|holly hunter|chris thomas king"

"o_brother_where_art_thou","O' Brother Whereart thouThis film is Set Mississippi in the 1930's. John GoodmanGeorge ClooneyActress who play Ms. Incredible as George Clooney's husband. This Film begins in black and white with prisoners working then turns to brown and white. Then we cut to three prisoners who escaped. It has one got a train.George Nelson shoots cows in robbery escape with money blowing out of car. Bank robberyNow people from radio recording station want the prisoners and African American for a contract for Soggy Bottom Boys the band after hearing the recording made a big hit on radio. the band they made for $10.00 each for recording one song. George Clooney constantly uses Dapper Dan use for hair. I am not a big fan of the overexposed orange and yellow look to this film. This is a redneck movie in my opinion. Do not seek the treasure. It is a trap. George Clooney says that There is no treasure. There never was. It was about getting to George Clooney trying to get back to his wife to avoid her getting married. George Clooney only needed the other two to help him get out of the jail. George Clooney's Wife kept saying he was run over by a train. Klu klux klan has black singer who sold himself to the devil. I am not a big fan of the music. Not my kind of music. Soggy Bottom Boys the band sounds stupid. Sounds like a terrible gross name for a band. Sounds like someone messed up there pants in the bathroom or in the swamp. Flood saved them from the devils hanging. The film ends in black and white. I was not into this film mainly because it was not my kind of film. Two of the prisoners are superstitious and one is big believer in God. George Clooney's character is the only looking for a more logical answer based upon science rather than looking to supernatural, superstitious, Devil, or God for the reason for how or why things occur. This film I guess shares similar characteristics to that of Homer and the Odyssey but told in a southern fashion but I did not enjoy that.","20","Drama, Comedy","george clooney|john turturro|tim blake nelson|john goodman|holly hunter|chris thomas king"

"o_brother_where_art_thou","O Brother, Where Art Thou is a dusty, nimble adventure that has it's own awesome sense of goofiness and fun. It looks and feels spectacular. It's bathed in browns and greys so it looks old and faded, but it isn't tired or dreary. It's exploding with quirkiness and energy. The prisoners run across stunning rural landscapes and quaint little farms dressed in pristine period jail uniforms and tattered rags. The prisoners are richly drawn and their idiosyncrasies are really amusing. Their dim-witted dialogue, exasperated expressions and adventures are hilarious. Some of the funniest moments were them escaping from the barn in flames, the opening where they clumsily run away from the work camp and the ending where the flood saves them from being hanged.Even though it encompasses themes like the Depression, racism, crime and even includes a KKK gathering, the film sustains a gleefully ironic and pleasant mood throughout, similar to something like Forest Gump. It's so fun that I didn't even notice the absence of any real cohesive story. It dances delightfully through one outrageous event after another and builds slowly to become an enthralling and absurd journey. And I loved all the clever period details, like the Slick Dan's hair gel, the cars, the bloodhounds, the populist politics. A lot of creativity and fun was put into the film. It was odd, but I really enjoyed it.","45","Drama, Comedy","george clooney|john turturro|tim blake nelson|john goodman|holly hunter|chris thomas king"

"a_very_murray_christmas","I like this special more in theory than in practice. The idea of a narrative in which Bill Murray puts on an old fashioned, live TV Christmas special with musical performances and celebrity guests is fun, and perhaps even brilliant. Even better, Murray and his entourage are foiled by bad weather and must resort to entertaining themselves in song with the various denizens of the hotel in which they are trapped. Unfortunately, the special loses its luster pretty quickly when it becomes painfully apparent that this is one of those passion/vanity projects that not nearly enough time or effort has been put into. It's clunky and feels cobbled together. It would hardly surprise me if Murray and company actually did shoot this thing on the fly during a blizzard. If you simply love the Murray, however, and want to see him be all sarcastic and endearing with other celebrities, then you'll be able to forgive quite a bit I'm sure.","25","Musical & Performing Arts, Comedy","george clooney|rashida jones|miley cyrus|bill murray|amy poehler|michael cera"

They were probably quite limited on budget, so the set pieces were kept to a minimum.I just feel like the production value ended up being a misstep and the overall product suffered. The music and connecting pieces were still pretty solid and quite funny - just not the overarching craziness a holiday musical could've been, maybe ala The Muppets Christmas Carol.","35","Musical & Performing Arts, Comedy","george clooney|rashida jones|miley cyrus|bill murray|amy poehler|michael cera"

"a_very_murray_christmas","Christmas films do not come as boring and meaningless as this. In a shocking turn of events, Sofia Coppola and Bill Murray's festive contribution for 2015, backed heavily by Netflix, has taken a premise that could and should have worked in an enormous way and completely bombed in spectacular fashion. It's Christmas eve and Bill Murray is set to host his own, live, televised Christmas sing a long, with big stars lining up to contribute. Sadly for Murray and his festivities, there is a terrible storm underway, which grid locks the city and grinds Murray's party to a halt. Heavily marketed as a warm and hilarious festive outing, with a subtle hint of melancholy, A Very Murray Christmas, fails in every possible regard at achieving what it originally sets out to do and then some. The film has no laughs what so ever, which is beyond strange considering the comedy genius has written the disaster, it leans so heavily on a blunt and bleak premise that any warmth and emotion is locked away behind its icy cold exterior and it never, ever manages to understand, never mind realize what it wants to achieve at any given moment. Its a huge disaster, with cameos from George Clooney, Michael Cera, Amy Poehler, Miley Cyrus and Jason Schwartzman to name but a few, but all the star power in the world cannot even begin to shed some light onto this grim and depressing affair. The songs are performed terribly, in what can only be presumed is the point, highlighting a shift in tone when the film eventually springs into life, too little too late. The overall look of the film echoes these emotions heavily, constantly feeling empty and cold, there is very little invigoration until the final 10 minutes, which by then means A Very Murray Christmas has sealed its own demise. I wanted to love this, I wanted to understand and be part of what I hoped was a wonderful, tongue in cheek and warming experience, instead I was left deflated, depressed and slightly suicidal by the end of the films short run time. Coppola enthusiasts have no leg to stand on here, A Very Murray Christmas is a disaster, one that hopefully vanishes into the cold, winter air and never resurfaces.","10","Musical & Performing Arts, Comedy","george clooney|rashida jones|miley cyrus|bill murray|amy poehler|michael cera"

Directed by Sofia Coppola this is a short film about Bill Murray trying to do a Christmas special where he sings and has a ton of guests joining him to do duets and features. It's told more in a story mode (not much like the variety shows you see actors do) and it works. There's a lot of charm to it and while the singing from everyone isn't exactly the best at times (this ain't Michael Buble) it has a lot of heart and real warmth there.

"10008700_darfur_now?","I suggest watching this documentary after watching 'The Devil Came on Horseback.' 'The Devil Came On Horseback' shows the horror of the genocide in Darfur, the huge scope of the problem and the apathy in the international community. It reminded me of the Holocaust, and made me wonder what I can do.'Darfur Now' helps to answer that question. It shows six diverse people from different walks of life, and how their efforts help the people of Darfur. It's more uplifting than 'The Devil Came On Horseback' because the emphasis is more on solutions than on the problem itself. If you are afraid that 'The Devil Came On Horseback is too harsh for you, (or for your older children,) 'Darfur Now' might be an easier film to watch and be aware of what is going on.The film has been criticized as being too glossy and too self-congratulating to have any credibility. I disagree. The issue can be successfully covered by a range of film styles.Some people say the crisis in Darfur is not a genocide, but rather a war over land. They say that the people who call it a genocide have ulterior political motives. I'm not an expert on genocide, but Arab nomads are killing black villagers, (all of them civilian) burning their villages and driving them from their homes.

From back room deals for big oil company mergers to a down on his luck middle eastern young man who turns to a terrorists group to find meaning and purpose in his life, this film seems like it is all over the place, but it is not. The stories are all interconnected and are really well done. No, at the end your not going to find out they are all related in that kind of interconnected way, but through the movie you will see how one thing affects the other like dominos.

He won a well deserved Oscar for his role in Syriana, and really put the film industry on notice that he wasn't just your run of the mill good looking guy, and that he was going to be taken seriously as an actor.

"syriana","I'm not going to waste much of your time with a long review here, mostly because I have no idea what was going on in this movie. Syriana is like an impenetrable mystery made up of countless little scenes that seemingly have no connection to one another. I appreciate films that find a way to limit expository dialogue as much as the next guy, but I feel like perhaps a moment or two to explain what is going on might make this enigma somewhat decipherable. You can't really complain about any of the acting performances, because I think they do just fine with what they are given, I just wish I understood what they were given. It's not often that a movie makes me feel dumb, but Syriana was very successful at that. I'm sure there's some deep geopolitical plot that has a lot to say about our world and the people who run it, and with multiple views you could unravel all the threads and have a solid story. However I see no reason to ever delve into this movie again to do that research considering the fact that it is shockingly boring. If a movie is this incoherent the least it could manage is to be exciting, instead looking further into this movie would be too much like work. I don't even connect with any of the characters, perhaps because I have no idea who they are, so there's no way for me to get emotionally invested. I'm delighted for those who can enjoy a film like Syriana, you are probably smarter than I am, just don't ask me to watch it with you.","10","Mystery & Suspense, Drama","george clooney|matt damon|jeffrey wright|christopher plummer|chris cooper|robert foxworth"

"syriana","This convoluting geopolitical thriller was generally well-performed and -managed to have moments of thrills while also having a nice theme after some thinking about its well-connected storylines that'd followed the similar format that was seen in 'Traffic.' Even though it's hard to follow when its plot lines were scrambling around with loose points, and ties of understanding, this film is enjoyably likable that requires another viewing to understand it completely (or more until those lines are all tied and understood).

The acting was very excellent, as one would expect from such a stellar cast. Some of the plot lines weren't nearly as interesting as others and could have been shortened or eliminated. The message here that big oil runs our government and the CIA interferes in the governments of other countries to the point of assignation, none of this is anything new that we didn't already know. That innocent people who mean well are often thrown to the wolves is nothing new in the history of the world. Neither is the idea that corrupt officials will find scapegoats to pay for their sins, so that they go unpunished.

"oceans_thirteen","Fantastically enjoyable third outing for Clooney and pals. The tortuous plot is great fun, with Al Pacino's Trump-like casino owner being comprehensively fleeced for doing the dirt on Danny Ocean's pal Reuben (Elliott Gould). The whole show is expertly choreographed, as always, by Steven Soderbergh and flies by. Intelligent popcorn.","40","Drama, Action & Adventure, Mystery & Suspense, Comedy","george clooney|brad pitt|matt damon|bernie mac|don cheadle|carl reiner"
"oceans_thirteen","Couple problems with this one. First, Al Pacino doesn't fit the role. Andy Garcia was perfect for the role of Terry Benedict, because he can be intimidating in a quiet manner. Al Pacino's character never really scared me. The bigger problem is that there is no suspense in this film. In the first film, you're wondering what's going to happen next, with twists along the way. In this one, you pretty much know what's going to happen and how. This takes away the surprise element that is so crucial in a heist film.","40","Drama, Action & Adventure, Mystery & Suspense, Comedy","george clooney|brad pitt|matt damon|bernie mac|don cheadle|carl reiner"

"oceans_thirteen","This film juxtaposed the funny and 'simple' charcters of george clooney and brad pitt against serious criminals. Every character spanning from Clooney to Pitt embodies a separate charcter that lets the story spin in a unique way. Sadly, most critics would like to capitalize on a certain film's failure, such as Ocean's 13. Sadly, I must tell the informed consumer that this film is a true return to comedy's origins. I regret to inform you that reviewers that gave this film less than a 3/5 probably did not watch the film to entirity.

"oceans_thirteen","Well, Ocean's 13 followed about the same formula as Ocean 11 & 12- which, I have to admit, got a bit tiring around the middle. But with such likable characters, it's hard not to enjoy the ride anyway. Who doesn't enjoy the notion that Shaobo Qin's character Yen can understand English perfectly while everyone else can understand Chinese perfectly? It's funny every time. But the prosthetic nose on Matt Damon's character made me actually nauseous which made the bizarre seduction scenes with Abagail Sponder extra repulsive- this was not a plus for the movie. Neither were some of the bad costumes- peering at George Clooney's Guapo Italiano getup, Brad Pitt's Fruit and Nut Earthquake Expert getup and Don Cheadle's Black Sista/Captain America Persona. In the end, however, I had a good time. I still enjoyed the guys winning everything in the end. One of my favorite characters continues to be Elliott Gould, who was great in the movie. And of course, I always love the all time hottie, Andie Garcia, who never disappoints. I can't give a half star or I would have given three and a half and I can't justify a four star rating so a three star will have to do!","35","Drama, Action & Adventure, Mystery & Suspense, Comedy","george clooney|brad pitt|matt damon|bernie mac|don cheadle|carl reiner"

"oceans_thirteen","Oceans 13I thought that the film started out slow because it was a lot of talking and set up discussions to what would happen later in the film. Jumping through the elevator corridors looked dangerous and crazy amazing. I like the American flag motorcycle costume. You shook Sanatra's hand so you should know better. I enjoyed the casting decisions for this film. The diamonds were donated towards charity for 200 kids to go to camp. I wish that there was a little more action to this film. The music in this film was pretty good. It was interesting how this started out be a plan for redemption but as more people came involved this became than just stealing money from one system but also diamonds for someone else if they are to be allowed to use drill to help disrupt the casino main computer and security system. I liked the dice machine that would make the dice role to the numbers they wanted to make 7.Is it as good as the first film. No, but I do like the fact that this is a different story and it sounds convincing. This also goes into stories concerning greed, loyalty, and dedication no matter the cost. Sticking up for those people in your life that mean the most.

"oceans_thirteen","Ocean's Thirteen is the final movie to the Ocean's series directed by Steven Soderbergh, and it stars George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Andy Garcia, Carl Reiner, Matt Damon, Bernic Mac, Don Cheadle, and Al Pacino in a heist film that is about the crew going to rob Willy's casino after screwing over one of Ocean's crew with his money. After the disappointing Ocean's Twelve, this movie goes back to the old roots of the first movie and do the same plot again, which makes me glad that it's better than the second film, even though it wasn't as great as the first movie. The big cast are still great as ever, and with Al Pacino giving a good addition to the film. The plot gives out some overly complex situations that makes the film a bit unrealistic. The writing by Brian Koppelman and David Levien is better written than the second film and it gives out more funny moments also, even if there were moments that weren't not that funny, and it doesn't really have that much of a character progression. It is more restrained than the second film, and the twists make more sense also.

"oceans_thirteen","On his CD 'Retaliation', Dane Cook said, 'More than sex, every guy would rather be part of a heist.'. While that may be true, I don't think watching a movie about a heist would be enough to trump sex, with the one possible exception being Stephen Soderbergh's 2001 remake of 'Ocean's 11'. Now, I'm not saying I would choose 'Ocean's 11' over sex, I'm just saying the movie might provide an 'interesting alternative' (God knows I'm going to have to do some MAJOR 'apologizing' for that one). Fast forward six years and one fairly lackluster sequel later, and you've got the most recent cinematic adventure featuring Danny Ocean & friends, aptly titled 'Ocean's 13'. With the exception of a little banter between George Clooney's Ocean and Brad Pitt's Rusty, who come off as the metrosexual version of an old, married couple, it's almost as if 'Ocean's 12' didn't happen - and the less said about that movie, the better. Soderbergh and friends more than make up for that blip on the radar with a movie that's equally as fun as the first one, if not more so in some areas. While there's something to be said for the freshness of an 'origin story', and 'Ocean's 11' was a fun example of how to accomplish that flawlessly, now that we know these guys, 'Ocean's 13' doesn't have to spend a whole act re-introducing us to the fellas, it just gets right into the meat of the story, and headfirst into the reason while we're all here - the heist and how it gets pulled off. For me, I was immediately taken in from the moment the colourful opening credit sequence began, harkening back to similar movies of the sixties, capturing the feel of the era more accurately than 'Austin Powers' ever could, and setting the mood for the comedic thrill-ride about to follow. I love the way Soderbergh & the screenplay are constantly foreshadowing in almost every scene, showing the audience what is to come later in ways both subtle (Danny & Rusty talking about Linus' prosthetic nose while wearing heavy winter coats) and not-so-subtle (Danny & Rusty 'cleaning' the V.U.P.'s room). The script, written by Brian Koppelman & David Levien, who also wrote John Dahl's 'Rounders', is a very well-executed example of how to make a well-balanced ensemble picture - I mean, even the Chinese guy has something to do in this movie. And while it's still obvious that Clooney & Pitt are the stars of the show, Matt Damon is great as the awkward Linus, forever the nerd trying to impress the 'cool kids', like that little mutt hopping around the bulldog from 'Looney Tunes'; and Don Cheadle also hit high marks for me, especially in the scene where he masquerades as an Evel Knievel-like Vegas daredevil. But the far and away MVP's of 'Ocean's 13' have to be Casey Affleck and Scott Caan, aka The Malloy Brothers, who, while doing their part in the caper at a dice factory in Mexico, help to spark a mini-revolution for better employment standards; it was definitely the highlight of the movie for me, taking the story in a very unexpected, but welcome, direction. The villain this time out is probably the only weak part of the flick, and that's saying a lot when the villain is being played by Al Pacino. I'm not saying he was bad, he just didn't bring much to the table - you expect more when you hear the name Pacino. Ellen Barkin, Pacino's 'Sea Of Love' co-star, was also just so-so as his second-in-command; even when she was trying to sex up Damon, she was very bland. Andy Garcia, however, turns in a solid performance, returning as heavy Terry Benedict, this time playing a bad guy playing a good guy, and having a Hell of a lot of fun in the process. Overall, 'Ocean's 13' is definitely a great popcorn flick. But is it better than sex? I guess that all depends on who you're having sex with.","45","Drama, Action & Adventure, Mystery & Suspense, Comedy","george clooney|brad pitt|matt damon|bernie mac|don cheadle|carl reiner"

"august_osage_county","This is a great family drama starring Meryl Streep as a tyrannical matriarch and Julia Roberts as one of her daughters. As members of the Weston family head to the family home following the suicide of their father, dark secrets emerge and skeletons just keep on rattling out of those closets. It is a comedy of the deepest black with plenty high melodrama along the way. The movie builds towards one of the most excruciating family meals where the acid-tongued Streep launches into several family members, taking no prisoners. The movie is also peppered with some deeply touching and moving scenes which help to sweeten the bitter nature of the plot and I was moved to tears at a number of points. Amongst the cast, I particularly liked Margo Martindale as Aunt Mattie Fae and Misty Upham as Johnna, the ever present, watchful and sensible nurse/housemaid. With both the leads giving fine performances and some lovely uses of the Oklahoma plains, there's very little that's not to like in August: Osage County as long as you're not expecting the Partridge Family.","40","Drama","meryl streep|julia roberts|juliette lewis|ewan mcgregor|abigail breslin|margo martindale"
"august_osage_county","All yelling and tears with no resolve. Its bs - painted all southern and 'perty like', but no charm in the least.Great cinematography, but its stained glass windows in a bowling alley. Wasted here.There are several much better movies from any of the big names listed here, but if you take the risk to view this, be warned - instead of phoning it in, they went all Mommy Dearest and it plain sucks. You truly won't believe all the quality names attached to this garbage.Consistent acting with a loud, terrible script.No balance in these bitter, weird characters - humorless throughout and seems staged, especially the big showdown dinner is pointlessly over the top. There was room to layer the characters and give them a human likeability, but this was an angry political debate - both sides hate the worst in the other side and smugly hold their ground - redundant and exasperating, as it is here.Do not waste your time on this belligerent, awful movie.Manipulative and coarse, all yelling and boo hooing - it will make you roll your eyes at a point.Too much.If you want to get screamed at for free, my I suggest that you go express your political views with people you don't care about and save your time and money that would be wasted on this piece of pretty trash.I did not say good or appropriate acting - just consistent, to be clear.1 smashed plate out of 5","10","Drama","meryl streep|julia roberts|juliette lewis|ewan mcgregor|abigail breslin|margo martindale"

"august_osage_county","If you think your family is dysfunctional, spend a couple hours with the Weston family of Osage County, Oklahoma, and you'll think your family is the Waltons.Let me introduce you to the Westons. Patriarch Beverly is a once-famous poet and self-ascribed alcoholic. His wife, Violet, is suffering from mouth cancer and is addicted to a multitude of pain killers and anti-anxiety medications. Violet is a mean and bitter piece of work. While your first thought may be that it's the pills talking, you quickly realise that she was this way long before she became ill. Perhaps her mouth cancer is karma for a lifetime of verbal abuse that she inflicted on those around her. Her causticness has pushed their three daughters, Barbara, Ivy and Karen, away. Only Ivy maintains a relationship with Violet, though she has learned - probably the hard way - to keep her private life private. Barbara, who now lives in Colorado, has developed a defensive toughness, which could explain why her marriage to college professor Bill is in its last throes. Youngest daughter Karen seems to have been most affected by the family dynamic. She has moved to Florida and is now engaged to Steve - a fast talking, fast driving, older man who has been married three times before.Violet also has a sister and brother-in-law, Mattie Fae and Charlie, whom she seems to love, or at least care about. Mattie Fae and Violet have a shared history of growing up in an abusive household. History repeats itself. Mattie Fae has written off their adult son, Little Charlie, who is a good person though a little slow on the uptake.The film opens with Bev hiring a Native American woman as a live-in cook and caregiver for Violet. When he disappears a few weeks later only to be found to have drowned, it's apparent to everyone that his death was a suicide.Violet, naturally, is distraught and the family gathers around her to provide her with moral support. Tensions comes to a boil at the post-funeral dinner table (don't they always?) when Barbara can no longer sit idly by while Violet inflicts each knife wound into her daughters with laser-guided precision. She is a woman who is determined to make everyone around her as miserable as she is. The sisters try to reconcile with each other and with their mother but they, like Violet, are already too damaged. In the end, all the can do is try to save themselves.August: Osage County was penned by Tracy Letts, who also wrote the Pulitzer Prize-winning play of the same name. This is a film that is all about the acting. There are no exploding cars or 3D effects to hold your attention. It's the just the actors and their words. To that end, Meryl Streep, as Violet, is superb. She once again proves why she is the most talented actress in American cinema today. All the other actors are mere moths buzzing around her flame. Some, like Chris Cooper and Margo Martindale have their moments in the spotlight but the film is really Meryl. If she wins the Best Actress Oscar (R), it will be well deserved.Go see this film but don't expect to be entertained in the conventional sense. Like much of Violet's medication, it's a bit of a downer. It is good acting though and, if your family is only half as screwed up as this family is, you will feel quite relieved.","40","Drama","meryl streep|julia roberts|juliette lewis|ewan mcgregor|abigail breslin|margo martindale"

"august_osage_county","What happens when four obnoxious daughters (and a Native American house keeper slash feminist overseer) all come together to bury their father who was driven to suicide by their borderline and sociopathic drug addicted mother who likes rocking to Eric Clapton, forced to face themselves in their own mirrors and fail in seeking any reconciliation, but prove they are all the stereotypical strong women surrounded by weak, doting beta males who should have all walked off the screen half way through the movie. It's a paragon epic of Steel Magnolias who should be institutionalized. The only redeeming character is Chris Cooper as Charles who excels in an epic moment announcing - with choice words and maintaining a gentleman's demeanor - that he's had enough of the drama permanently. It's the only life-line moment in the entire film. I've watched many star-filled casts of female-themed films from 1939's 'The Women' to this vile swill of toxic waste and can say with with complete certainty it's the most repulsive film I've ever watched in my life. Yes, the acting is impressive and the cinimatgraphy excellent, and it is the most shamefully horrendous story of bleakness defining the post-modern feminist woman ever conceived. I'm puzzled as to the compulsion for such a novel - let alone it be made into a film loaded with a star-studded cast. Writers are known to glean their inspiration for novels from true life, and if it's true that a house full of women can come together after the suicide of their father and behave this way in real life, I don't want to know.","05","Drama","meryl streep|julia roberts|juliette lewis|ewan mcgregor|abigail breslin|margo martindale"

What gives a mother the right to cause such damage to her children and her spouse? Meryl Streep did an unbelievable job portraying a very mean, self centered, drug addicted, deeply damaged mother. As the plot unfolds like an onion, the viewer becomes privy to more and more of the family's secrets. Even though, the acting is tremendous, I didn't attach myself enough to any of the characters to care about the outcome. I didn't have any sympathy for Meryl Streep's character. Even though, she came from a very cruel upbringing, she wasn't able to rise above and not pass that damage on to the ones closest to her. Each one of her daughters suffer in predictable fashion from being raised by her, especially succumbing to attachment issues. All three daughters, were not able to form successful relationships in their own ways. The story is believable and most likely most people can see some of their own families' characteristics.

Now that that's out of the way, what the hell was up with those vampires?The first half of this movie is standard Tarantino/Rodriguez material. It's Tarantino's dialogue and Rodriguez's directing, and both those guys have a very loud and recognizable style to what they do. It's sort of like Pulp Fiction in Texas, with two morally broken characters trying to achieve something and killing a whole bunch of people along the way. I love the dialogue and the outrageous violence, and I liked the weird rapport they develop with a family they take as hostages, but it can't be denied how damn unlikable these two are. Clooney's character manages to have some charm, mainly because it's Clooney playing him, but Tarantino's character is downright despicable. I actually like both the performances here, and they have pretty good chemistry with each other and even look like brothers, but they're just so awful it's kind of hard to enjoy following them. Tarantino is no stranger to characters who are awful human beings, but they usually have some redeeming qualities and are at least enjoyable to watch. For a large chunk of this movie though I really didn't like following these guys. Which makes a slight conflict in this movie, since even though I think the first half is technically better than the second half, the second half does fix this problem.The second half of the movie turns into something completely different. Basically the final 40-50 minutes is a balls out gorefest of them dealing with the fact they are suddenly in a bar filled with vampires. Again, pros and cons to this half. Main thing is it becomes much more limited, with the rest of the movie taking place in this bar, and as fun and outrageous as the gore is it becomes a bit tiring after a while. Having said that, this is some of the craziest gory action I've seen in film, and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't enjoying watching it. I also like how quick they are to accept they're situation, basically saying 'I don't believe in vampires, but yep, these are vampires'. Clooney also becomes more likable here, taking on something of a reluctant hero role just to survive. I was surprised that by the end I found myself kind of liking his character.From Dusk Till Dawn has some major flaws, and they're pretty hard to ignore. Even so, the sheer insanity and originality of this movie kind of make them forgivable. It's a movie that makes you think it's about one thing, then pulls the rug out from under you and tells you it's actually about something else. Kind of like The Crying Game of horror movies. I really admire that in a strange way. It's flawed, but it's so crazy and fun that I couldn't help but like it.","40","Drama, Horror, Mystery & Suspense","harvey keitel|george clooney|quentin tarantino|juliette lewis|cheech marin|fred williamson"

"from_dusk_till_dawn","Have you ever seen a film that starts out quite good, and then somehow, everything goes straight to shit? That is From Dusk Till Dawn in a nutshell. Being quite the Quentin Tarantino enthusiast, I hate to admit I was disappointed on this film. It is strange how one can identify the exact moment when everything starts crumbling down. Almost as if one movie was ending and another starting. Even more depressing is the fact that a promising plot ends up as nothing more than a tasteless and thoughtless 'horror' movie. Not that fear was felt at any point throughout this film.The films starts out nicely with a combination of Tarantino's detailed, descriptive, and witty dialogue and Director Robert Rodriguez's ability to turn a small budget into a surprisingly decent movie. It is not a secret the Quentin Tarantino is a much better writer and director than an actor; this is obvious in all his films. In this film, George Clooney's presence makes Tarantino's acting seems even worse than it actually is. But this is not the only problem.[Spoilers ahead] There is an exact moment were the film gives us a monumental surprise. The movie we were watching is not there anymore. This is not a movie about robbers, but a movie about vampires. Fake blood everywhere, ridiculous battles, and finally, a confusing conclusion. This might have been the whole point of the movie, but it turns into a joke. I guess I am just not a fan of vampire comedy... If the second half can even be called comedy.","20","Drama, Horror, Mystery & Suspense","harvey keitel|george clooney|quentin tarantino|juliette lewis|cheech marin|fred williamson"

The campy/horror/vampire filled third act, which is fun don't get me wrong, just isn't worthy of the very rich set up. In other words, the first two acts of the film are just too good for the campy B movie horror that was the main intent of From Dusk Till Dawn.With that in mind, I will still recommend the film... but if you're going into it without any knowledge of its intent or the supernatural twist, you will definitely feel robbed of the film that could have been.","30","Drama, Horror, Mystery & Suspense","harvey keitel|george clooney|quentin tarantino|juliette lewis|cheech marin|fred williamson"

It's not just that the script has his hallmarks, Rodriguez shoots many of the scenes exactly the way Tarantino would have (shot looking up from inside a trunk anyone?). It's really like a pretty mediocre Tarantino film. It's got all the elements of one of his films, but they never really gel. That's all about the first half. The second half of this film is a pretty generic action-horror-gorefest. It's not bad, but it's never anything more than okay.

"from_dusk_till_dawn","Two brothers, Seth (George Clooney) and Richard 'Richie' Gecko (Quentin Tarantino), having just robbed a bank, stop at a liquor store to pick up a map. When the arrival of Texas Ranger Earl McGraw threatens their getaway, they kill him and the cashier, burning down the store in the process. During the gunfight, Richie is shot in the hand. Fleeing a combined force of FBI and local police, they head towards Mexico where a contact has arranged a safe-house for them. Along the way they stop at a motel and unload a bank teller whom they are holding hostage. While Seth goes out to 'sight see' checking on the border and to buy fast food burgers, Richie brutally rapes and murders the teller. Seth, who pictures himself as a professional thief, becomes furious over Richie's sadistic behavior, but forgives his brother, embracing him and talking about how their future will be better in Mexico. Meanwhile, Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel), a pastor who is experiencing a crisis of faith due to the passing of his wife, arrives at the same motel with his daughter Kate (Juliette Lewis) and his adopted son Scott, who is of Chinese descent. The Geckos kidnap the family and order Jacob to take them across the border in his RV. After a tense inspection by a border guard, the group crosses into Mexico. They stop at the 'Titty Twister', an isolated strip club and brothel where the Geckos have arranged to meet their contact Carlos at dawn. Seth and Richie beat up the doorman, Chet Pussy, when he tries to deny the group entry. Although the bartender initially refuses to serve them, he relents after Jacob successfully argues that he is a trucker, but Seth remains annoyed by the disrespect. They take a table, and Seth encourages everyone to drink as the strip show begins. Richie takes special notice of the club's star performer, Santánico Pandemónium (Salma Hayek), during an extended solo performance, after which Chet Pussy and some others confront the group. When Richie is stabbed in his already wounded hand, Santánico transforms into a horrific vampire and attacks him, biting him on his neck, which causes him to bleed to death...Roger Ebert gave it three out of four stars and described it as 'a skillful meat-and-potatoes action extravaganza with some added neat touches'. In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote, 'The latter part of From Dusk till Dawn is so relentless that it's as if a spigot has been turned on and then broken. Though some of the tricks are entertainingly staged, the film loses its clever edge when its action heats up so gruesomely and exploitatively that there's no time for talk'. Entertainment Weekly gave the film a 'B' rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, 'Rodriguez and Tarantino have taken the let-'em-eat-trash cynicism of modern corporate moviemaking and repackaged it as junk-conscious 'attitude.' In From Dusk till Dawn, they put on such a show of cooking up popcorn that they make pandering to the audience seem hip'. However, in his review for the Washington Post, Desson Howe wrote, 'The movie, which treats you with contempt for even watching it, is a monument to its own lack of imagination. It's a triumph of vile over content; mindless nihilism posing as hipness'. Cinefantastique magazine's Steve Biodrowski wrote, 'Whereas one might reasonably have expected that the combo of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez would yield a critical mass of nuclear proportions, instead of an atomic fireball's worth of entertainment, we get a long fuse, quite a bit of fizzle, and a rather minor blast'. In his review for the San Francisco Chronicle, Mick LaSalle called the film, 'an ugly, unpleasant criminals-on-the-lam film that midway turns into a boring and completely repellent vampire 'comedy.' If it's not one of the worst films of 1996 it will have been one miserable year'. In Marc Savlov's review for the Austin Chronicle, he wrote, 'Fans of Merchant-Ivory will do well to steer clear of Rodriguez's newest opus, but both action and horror film fans have cause for celebration after what seems like a particularly long splatter-drought. This is horror with a wink and a nod to drive-in theatres and sweaty back seats. This is how it's done'. This is yet another Quentin Tarantino vehicle (with Robert Rodriguez at the steering wheel) I have gotten back to lately and re-seen with a personal negative response in the end. When re-seeing 'From Dusk Till Dawn' it just feels like the same old ultra violent never ending dialogue driven action dribble we have seen so many times now from Quentin. They both believed in their on hype and thought they could get away with whatever at that point. Something they repeated with their Grindhouse films 'Death Proof' and 'Planet Terror'. Throughout the years I have become so tired of this action set up and Quentin´s accepted freedom to push down this 'mindless violent nihilism' (as Desson Howe wrote) down our throats and getting away with it due to some sort of comic relief in the midst of the gore. The problem with 'From Dusk Till Dawn' is that it starts off as one type of film and ends up as something else. The overlapping of the genres doesn´t fully work and the special effects are quite poor. And we get to see the usual Tarantino/Rodriguez suspects in several roles which in one way makes the film a bit richer but also too familiar and boring. Yes, at that point it was 'fresh' to see George Clooney play such an unlikeable character. And as I have said so many times, Quentin Tarantino should´ve never put himself in any films as he can´t act. Then again, we have the hubris issue.... And it boggles my mind that Tarantino as the writer, assumed that we would find his character, the murderous sexual deviant Richie, ok as being some sort of babbling psychotic comic relief. Tarantino/Rodriguez tries to outstage each other with whom can come up with the most crazy character or weapon. Such as Sex Machine and his crotch-based gun that only fires when 'erect'... That´s just bad in my opinion. Not cool, not funny. Just B-Movie crappy. I reckon the film wants to be offensive, but misses the target with miles as the bits and pieces simply can´t connect. The best part in this movie is the lovely Salma Hayek and her character Santánico Pandemónium. That´s pretty much it.","30","Drama, Horror, Mystery & Suspense","harvey keitel|george clooney|quentin tarantino|juliette lewis|cheech marin|fred williamson"

"money_monster","GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Scott, it s time for the newest PBS/HBO Sesame Street character Money Monster.SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Wrong movie, Greg. This monster is all too human and realistic, I m afraid, Let s recap.GREG: We re introduced to Lee Gates (George Clooney) a financial personality who has a daily show on the Financial News Network (FNN). He tells people the hottest tips for investing. In his ear is his producer Patty Fenn (Julia Roberts) who has secretly taken a new job, because Gates is such a pain in the ass. They re putting on their latest dazzling display of financial wizardry leading with the story of IBiS Global s loss of $800 Million due to a computer glitch. SCOTT: In the middle of Gates s show, a young man named Kyle Budwell (Jack OConnell) breaks into the studio and takes Gates hostage. With the camera still rolling and on live television, Budwell makes Gates wear a vest containing a bomb that will explode if Budwell lets go of his hand control unit. We learn that Budwell lost his life savings totalling $60,000 because of the IBiS glitch. He blames Gates for strongly recommending the stock, and he will detonate the bomb unless he gets an explanation.GREG: This movie had a lot going for it - at first. I thought it was going to be an assault on the financial divide. Which is where it started. But as the drama played out, it became more about a singular CEO who gamed an online trading program to make off with $800 million to destabilize an African country s platinum mines. A shrewd investment - as it could triple its value overnight. However, it s both illegal and immoral. The investor s response was that it was money and money has its own morality. So, rather than deal with the real challenges of the market (as did The Big Short), the director and writers played it safe with one fictional arbitrage investor. It turns out to be quite dull.SCOTT: Greg, I think this movie does indeed feed off the anger Americans feel toward Wall Street and big businesses that place greed ahead of humanity. Our hero is everyman Kyle Budwell, who is mad as hell and just won t take it anymore. In an unlikely pairing, he and Lee Gates become buddy heroes who start out as enemies but evolve into a single team of truth-seekers who are driven to expose the misdeeds of IBiS s CEO Walt Camby (Dominic West). Money Monsters held my attention, despite its predictability, as we know IBiS is the villain and that Budwell must die to make his point. I enjoyed Clooney s performance and reveled in the tense take-down of the corrupt, villainous fat-cat Camby.GREG: The heroes here are Gates and Budwell with Fenn constantly in Gates ear. She reminded me of Jiminy Cricket - giving advice and encouragement from behind the glass windows. As you point out, Gates and Budwell become a sort of buddy hero team - starting apart and gradually growing closer as the film progresses. In the end Budwell reveals to Gats that the suicide vest he is wearing is packed with clay, not explosives. While it wasn t necessary, Budwell commits suicide by cop when he appears to take his thumb off the dead-man s trigger and the entire police force shoot him down.SCOTT: Fenn is indeed Gates mentor, leaving Budwell without one -- unless you count his histrionic girlfriend Molly (Emily Meade) who is briefly videoed into the studio to help but instead douses the situation with gasoline with her vitriolic excoriation of Budwell. Molly could thus be considered a dark mentor. Another possible dark mentor is our arch villain Camby, who betrays his prot g Diane Lester (Caitriona Balfe).GREG: Money Monster is the movie that could have been. While it has a good cast and an able director in Jodie Foster, the climax left me wanting. The ending with a martyred Budwell was telescoped from the beginning and was wholly unnecessary. While I was entertained for a couple hours, I didn t leave the theater feeling smarter or more introspective about the world of high finance. I give Money Monster 3 out of 5 Reels. The hero story was good enough with Gates and Budwell portraying a classic buddy hero pattern - starting out at odds and ending up on the same page. Clooney s Gates rang true to the several money investment types I ve seen on cable news channels. And Budwell came across as an everyman who had been pulled to his wit s end. I give them 3 Heroes. The mentors were pretty weak in this story. Fenn is constantly in Gates ear but offers more direction than actual advice. Scott, you pointed out the dark mentors which I agree - but they got scant screen time. They only get 2 Mentors from me. Movie: Mentor: Hero: SCOTT: I d say you re pretty much on the money with your assessments, Gregger. I enjoyed Money Monster for what it is, namely, a tense drama exposing the unbridled greed of our times and its calamitous effects on common everyday people. The performances by George Clooney and Julia Roberts are well worth watching, and we get a satisfying ending that signals hope and justice for our corrupt society. Like you, I award this film 3 Reels out of 5. Our two heroes start out as unlikely buddies but they evolve into people who sense that the true enemies are not each other but Walt Camby, the evil CEO of IBiS. The hero story is satisfying because our two buddies undergo a transformation -- Gates starts out an arrogant ass and becomes humbled by dire circumstances. Budwell s extreme actions make Gates transformation possible, and Gates works with Fenn to help educate Budwell about the true villain at work in the story. It s a pretty decent hero s journey worthy of 3 Heroes out of 5. The mentorship is better than you give it credit for, Greg. Fenn is indispensable as a smooth, wise, voice of reason for Gates. She gets him through this crisis. Budwell, meanwhile, receives some mentoring directly from Gates and indirectly from Fenn. He also operates by an internal code of justice. We also have a bit of dark mentoring from Budwell s girlfriend and from Camby directed toward Lester. So overall, I have no qualms awarding 3 out of 5 Mentors here, too.

Ho trovato la storia ben fatta, con personaggi ben caratterizzati ed un antagonista motivato e comprensibile.

It was decently paced, it had solid acting, and a good script. These all add up to construct a very good thriller. That doesn't mean that it didn't have flaws. The character development was good, but there were too many characters to keep up with. Some of them got annoying after a while. George Clooney and Julia Roberts pulled off fairly believable performances. Everyone else wasn't committed to their roles at all.For me, the film was anti-climactic. This is mainly because it got very predictable near the end.Over all, Money Monster was a great thriller, but something just made it predictable. 3/5 stars","30","Drama","george clooney|julia roberts|jack o'connell|dominic west|caitriona balfe|giancarlo esposito"

I think that many people avoided this when it was first released, under the assumption of foreseeable situations and outcomes. This may be the case, but only for half the movie. Despite its predictability on the whole, MONEY MONSTER manages to payout with another stellar performance from George Clooney and a few innovative curveballs that breathe new life into a limited trite movie theme.","30","Drama","george clooney|julia roberts|jack o'connell|dominic west|caitriona balfe|giancarlo esposito"

"money_monster","As a thriller this was fairly average. There were moments of tension and Jack O'Connell did a decent job of the desperate man who had lost everything, desperate to bring those who had wronged him to justice. Julia Roberts had a decent role as the TV producer trying to save the life of her presenter yet still maintain high ratings and then there was George Clooney. George's character was difficult to like, he plays a really OTT TV personality, advising his viewers of risks to take on the stock market. I felt he didn't really fit the role, it was just uncomfortable and embarrassing watching him pretend to be bling for the viewers. I would also say how the story is resolved was pretty unrealistic and at some points it delves into the realms of fantasy when it asks us to believe in a couple of set pieces near the end. Not the worst I've ever seen but also a bit of a let down.","30","Drama","george clooney|julia roberts|jack o'connell|dominic west|caitriona balfe|giancarlo esposito"

"money_monster","Money Monster had an electrifying pace with an urgent sense (as it near enough takes place in real time) which made it a joy to watch. It reminded me a lot of phone booth except this had a lot more politics going on around it which at times slowed it down, but gave the film more context and explanation. The direction is solid from Foster and the tension is built carefully (although the score was below average). The performances were good, George Clooney showed off his range and Julia Roberts was good as a calming influence. Jack O'Connell was very believable, I liked him a lot. Some little details in this film let it down but on a Saturday evening, this is a fun and entertaining watch. It has a rewatchability that I didn't expect.","35","Drama","george clooney|julia roberts|jack o'connell|dominic west|caitriona balfe|giancarlo esposito"
"money_monster","Money Monster Review: A Good Investment Gone Wrong  A shady hacker in the movie Money Monster reminds viewers what most of us already believe about the stock market: 'if nobody can understand the math, then nobody has to explain the money.' And that's the problem with the movie Money Monster. It aims to take your brain on a roller coaster ride, but ultimately fails in the end. Mostly because it's a desperate hostage situation turned into a morality tale about corruption of wall street. Overall, a movie worth watching if a friend is paying; Otherwise, it might be best to wait until it hits Redbox. So, the real question is what would you do if you lost your entire savings on a bad investment? Directed by Jodie Foster (Actress in The Silence of the Lambs-A classic.) Starring George Clooney (Batman & Robin 1997) who plays Lee Gates, a financial TV Host, Julia Roberts (Secret in Their Eyes) who plays Lee Gates' Producer, Patty Fenn, and Jack O'Connell (300: Rise of an Empire) plays Kyle Budwell, A delivery man and soon-to-be father who loses his entire savings in the stock market. If there is no risk, there is no reward. Right? That's what Kyle Budwell believed when he 'invested' his entire inheritance-which he was going to use to take care of his family-into an investment firm known as Ibis, as advised by TV host Lee Gates by saying that it's 'Safer than your savings account.' This case turned into all risk with zero reward when Ibis loses 800 million dollars. Searching for answers, Kyle sneaks on stage while Lee Gates is on a live set and quickly turns the show into a live hostage situation for the world to see. Holding a gun and forcing Lee Gates to wear a vest with a bomb strapped to it, Kyle demands answers as to how Ibis could have possibly lost eight hundred million dollars due to a so-called computer glitch. Lee Gates and his producer, Patty Fenn, are forced into following the money trail-taking this suspense filled film into a wild twist. Ibis CEO Walt Camby (Dominic West) also becomes involved in this wild wall street story with an attempt at giving 'corporate answers' which a troubled Kyle doesn't want to hear. Spoiler: the ending takes a crash-similar to wall street. Great acting, great scenes; but if you've watched any movie that has anything to do with wall street, you'll likely know how it ends. Corruption.","25","Drama","george clooney|julia roberts|jack o'connell|dominic west|caitriona balfe|giancarlo esposito"

The second act stutters mid way through... emotional conversation between protagonist and antagonist too drawn out.

"money_monster","Average movie starring George Clooney and Julia Roberts about a gunman who takes a TV show hostage. I thought initially the premise was very interesting until the motives of the Gunnar were made clear. It was extremely predictable and executed pretty sloppily in my opinion. I thought that behind the scenes things going on outside of the studio did not add up which made the plot very muddled. Clooney was really good as the energetic host of 'Money Monster,' a stock tip show with a sort of hip hop edge. Roberts was the shining star for me as the no nonsense producer who tries to hold everything together when the gunman takes control of the set. Again good idea, just bad execution in my opinion. It went a direction that almost made me facepalm with the level of predictability on display. When you think of a gunman holding a TV set hostage, you would hope the intensity level would be at a 10. Unfortunately it was about a 5 which in turn made the movie unconvincing to me.","30","Drama","george clooney|julia roberts|jack o'connell|dominic west|caitriona balfe|giancarlo esposito"

The result is a total mayhem, a film which makes no sense whatsoever... And nothing is more unwelcome and ununderstandable than the way stars end up portraying themselves... Even the arrival of Bruce Willis and Vincent Cassel can't help it--it fails at almost every level. The only reason that I can find which would justify its viewing is to see an impressive lineup of stars, since the only reason which justified its making was to collect an impressive amount of money.","15","Drama, Action & Adventure, Comedy","george clooney|brad pitt|matt damon|bernie mac|don cheadle|catherine zeta-jones"

Nevertheless, the plot is a problem, because the ending is anti-climactic. The bigger problem is the lack of chemistry between Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones. One of the reasons Ocean's 11 worked is the chemistry/snappy dialogue of George Clooney and Julia Roberts.

"oceans_twelve","Ocean's Twelve is a sequel to the well received remake that's also directed by the same director, and it has the same crew before, but with new actors like Catherine Zeta-Jones and Vincent Cassel, and it continues the story by the fact that Terry Benedict got his money stole by the Ocean crew, and he threaten them to give back his money. So the crew has to give him back the money with a problem that they payed some of the millions that they had from it. I do like that it's continuing the story from the previous movie instead of doing the same plot as before, but it ended up being not as smart as the first movie. The script is written by George Nolfi, it sadly doesn't have the snappy dialogue that the first one did, and it was trying to be funnier than the first one which half the time I did laugh, and the other half I didn't, as it was a bit too silly which felt out of place. Some of the decisions that the characters made are very idiotic and felt lazy which I don't understand why they think it was even smart to do that in the first place. The cast are still great in it, and I was quite interested to see where it was going at times. I like the chemistry between Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones, and there were some cool moments that I liked.

"rock_star","It's a shame that 'professional critics' lose site of what the movie has to offer. It may not fit the criteria of a textbook movie, but I can say, unequivocally, for anyone who was into metal and hair bands in the late 70's and early 80's will get out of it what was intended. The movie has a phenomenal soundtrack with music written for the movie by some of the greats of the genre as well as classic music of the time. Anyone entering into the movie with the intention of picking it apart will have ample opportunity, but it wasn't written for them. Anyone who is a fan of metal, will relate to the story of the small garage band star making it big as front man (or woman) with great music to more than support the story. The soundtrack itself is worth buying. Very well done and though the movie is touted as the story of Judas Priest, only the Priest knows what went on behind the scenes. Just watch it on it's own merits and enjoy some great rock and roll.","50","Drama, Musical & Performing Arts, Comedy","mark wahlberg|jennifer aniston|timothy spall|timothy olyphant|dominic west|jason bonham"
"rock_star","This is fast, fun, funny and campy. For good-enough films I normally rate down from a perfect for various flaws but there's no reason to rate this film down. It does what it comes to do, which is obviously to 'rock'. If I tried to rate it from the bottom up for its virtues like a not-good-enough film, it wouldn't get that great of a score but that's because I'm not a metal head and this isn't something I'd normally watch. I got lucky, I guess, and got it as a gift from a neighbor who was moving back to Detroit. The costumers, makeup artists, and sound technicians definitely had a field day with this one. The movie has a fun premise: a rock and roll tribute band (basically a cover band that goes all the way, with dress-up and voice stylings) has its troubles until the lead singer gets the real gig as the lead singer of the band he loves so much. Jennifer Aniston and Mark Wahlberg don't over-draw or over-exert themselves, and put in a pretty genuine performance. The self-deprecating humour millennials expect is delivered subtly by everyone involved and doesn't screw up the beat. And we find out that the original lead singer is being pushed out of the band because he's lazy -- but there's a direct insinuation that it's because he's gay. Well, the casting of Mark Wahlberg for the part of the rags-to-riches dream boy was well placed, because Wahlberg is a proven natural vocal talent. Well, the movie moves on to dealing with issues of flagrant sexuality which is an everlasting hallmark of rock music, and wanton lust is a hit or miss subject for any writer. Lucky for the viewer, there are few proposed complications and the sheer megalomania is allowed to continue unabated. The movie doesn't do anything to give itself hiccoughs and that's the important part. It does lag a little, though. Around the time any kind of dramatic dilemma is introduced, I felt like the film should have about an hour left to it but there was only half an hour left to go. And it's really endearing how the climax touches the heart with the simple conundrum of honesty. Well, it's obvious that everyone involved with every aspect of the production did everything they could to send across a completely hollow feeling whenever it was needed, which is really, really important to rock music. And in the end, the film lends a note to what really makes rock music important to its fans to begin with. I think there's an ending to this film that was set up in an earlier scene and for some reason it got wrote out, but, I'm actually glad I watched it and since I feel like it should have gone on longer, I give it 5/5. The only bad thing I can say about it is that if it were a film about a Yes tribute band, I would have watched it the day it showed.","50","Drama, Musical & Performing Arts, Comedy","mark wahlberg|jennifer aniston|timothy spall|timothy olyphant|dominic west|jason bonham"
"rock_star","It's well worth a watch. You can feel the connection between Jenifer Aniston and Mark Wahlberg.

"rock_star","I can say Rock Star is my least favorite film I've seen in a while. Even the poster looks like a sappy inspirational mushfest. The film is nothing more than a predictable, lazy, and tired story with every cliche you can name.A small town kid in a tribute band for his favorite heavy metal group follows his dreams when the group hires him as their new lead singer. As he hits the big time, he succumbs to drugs, sex, and rock and roll.Rock Star is generic, tired, and misleading with its big name stars. The story is overused, predictable, even cringe worthy at some points about how unbelievably tame it is and its attempts at inspirational themes. Even Wahlberg himself does a terrible job in his role, the characters are bland and are overdone cliches of hair band Brit rockers. The overused tired scheme of follow your dreams, rise to fame turns to real heartfelt downfall, things are mended by the end. Rock Star is bland and predictable. Skip out on this horrendously cringeworthy $2 bin material.

"perfect_storm","Judging from the critical consensus here on RT, I'm not sure quite what film the critics were watching, but it wasn't 'The Perfect Storm'.Personally I found the events to be sufficiently dramatic thanks to Wolfgang Peterston's sure handed direction. The initial drama sequences leading up to the storm are developed well and give enough basic introductory information about the crew without being too long or boring. When the storm does eventually hit, the action sequences are breathtaking thanks to the magnificent blend of nice CGI (which still stands up nearly 17 years on) and real live effects, with plenty of heart pounding shots of the actors being buffeted and assailed by water. It all looks incredibly realistic thus creating a palpable sense of mortal danger.I even thought the inclusion of the rescue crew and the distress of the small boat with the crew of three was welcome alongside the main event of Andrea Gail. I found myself instantly on board (excuse the pun) in wanting them all to survive and caring much more about characters in this film who had barely any screen than those who dominate an entire Roland Emerick movie.While the picture quality on Blu-Ray leaves quote a bit to be desired, the sound quality is very good with complimentary realistic foley effects and a decent musical score.Finally, Wolfgang Peterson keeps a steady pace and brings the movie life with vibrant energy. 4/5","40","Drama, Action & Adventure","george clooney|mark wahlberg|diane lane|karen allen|william fichtner|mary elizabeth mastrantonio"

"perfect_storm","Finally watched it after 16 years on the shelf. The effects hold up and the cast is engaging, but it's all sound and fury signifying nothing. It should be a crime to lead with 'based on a true story' only to have all the principles die before telling their tale. The stock characters in port are there to ratchet up the anxiety and give our heroes a life to return to. Other than Wahlberg's character, who misses out on returning to foxy Diane Lane, I prefer the fates of the other crew members who are lost at sea. We spend much time with the Coast Guard and their futile attempt to get our boys back home, as well as the channel nine weather crew, who pop in occasionally to marvel at the intensity of the perfect storm.

The visual effects are extraordinary and the cinematography is fine. The film has got plenty of good acting from all the stars except Diane Lane who at towards unbearable extends. One good thing about this film is that it does not try to show the effects of the storm on just one ship on whom the main actors are aboard, but instead it shows the turmoils of a few other ships that are drowned in the storm and also the Coast Guard rescue team that tries to help these people. In doing so, some may feel that the film fails to provide enough characterization for it's key players.

"the_monuments_men","SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Greg, it s time to review The Monuments Men starring George Clooney, who also wrote and directed the film.GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) It wasn t a monumental film but I enjoyed myself. Let s recap.SCOTT: The year is 1944. The second world war is nearing an end as Allied troops close in on Hitler s German forces. As European cities are being reduced to rubble, an American museum curator named Frank Stokes (George Clooney) is concerned about the safety of all the priceless works of art in Europe. These paintings and statues are at risk of being destroyed or stolen by either the Nazis or the Russians.GREG: Stokes needs help and he knows who he wants with him. So, in a scene reminiscent of The Dirty Dozen he travels around the art community picking up six old friends (and I do mean old). Richard Campbell (Bill Murray), Walter Garfield (John Goodman), Donald Jeffries (Hugh Bonneville) and Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban) join Stokes along with younger men James Granger (Matt Damon) and Frenchman Jean Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin). They are all civilians and so must endure a comical bout of basic training. Once they are on their way, they are met with resistance from men on the front lines. Stokes tries to dissuade allied commanders from bombing priceless buildings only to meet resistance in the face of saving art over saving lives.SCOTT: Greg, The Monuments Men is a pretty good movie that means well. But it fell far short of what it could have been, especially given that the movie assembled such a luminary cast. In fact, that star-studded cast may have been the albatross that weighed the film down (to mix metaphors). When I see George Clooney, Bill Murray, and John Goodman on the screen, I see those actors rather than the characters they are playing. The Butler made the same mistake last year. One or two mega-stars is fine, but having superstar actors in every scene is unnecessary and distracting. Why not find some lesser known quality actors to play a few of these roles? A second problem the movie suffers from is predictability. There is a scene in The Monuments Men where John Goodman gets shot at from a window in an abandoned building. There is tension: who could be this mystery shooter? No one should be surprised that it ends up being a child. And of course we know that the film must conclude with the men finding the prized Madonna of Bruges statue. There are other issues, too, but before I go on I want to hear you weigh in here, Greg.GREG: I found Monuments Men to be a light (if not light hearted) World War II era film about a subject that had gone unnoticed until now - Hitler s obsession with art. As the Germans invaded city after city, they rounded up all the art (and gold) they could find. The tension in this film is created by a deadline. With the allies closing in on Berlin, Hitler has given an order to destroy all the art rather than leave it to the Russians or Americans. I bought into this story, Scott. I didn t expect a lot of character acting. I was satisfied to watch the heroes in this story figure out where the stolen art was being kept and race to find it before the Germans turned it to ash. The lighter moments of the film were offset by some more dramatic moments. While there were few very high or very low points, I got the message: people come and go, but our art tells the story of civilization and it is worth our lives to protect it.SCOTT: To me, that message was communicated somewhat poorly, Greg. In the middle of the movie, George Clooney s character gives a rousing speech that says, essentially, that whereas human lives are temporary, art is forever. That sounds noble, but his speech also implies that human lives are expendable in the effort to preserve paintings - a not so noble belief. Bottom line is that characters in this movie willingly die in the service of preserving artwork, and I can (grudgingly) accept this loss of life because it was their choice. But one gets the sense that Clooney (and the movie) are telling us that any lives are worth risking to preserve artwork, including the lives of civilians who certainly aren t freely choosing to risk themselves. The fourth and final issue I had was that the heroes in the movie don t grow. Good hero stories show us how heroes become transformed. But these monuments men show a selfless courage from the beginning of the movie to the very end. I have the same problem with the character of Katniss Everdeen in the Hunger Games, who also shows heroic qualities from beginning to end and never grows. Yes, the characters in The Monuments Men are heroes but we, the audience, are most satisfied when we see heroes undergo significant change and evolution. This just doesn t happen in this film.GREG: I didn t get that message from the movie. I don t recall any civilian loss of life in the efforts to save the lost art. The message I got was that these men were so committed to preserving our (combined) heritage that *they* were willing to risk, and in some cases give, their lives. It was both noble and heroic. And the orders to save this art came from on high. Truman himself signed the orders and that makes him a hero, too. As we ve seen before, heroes don t always transform (themselves or others). Sometimes they perform a selfless act and that alone is enough to earn them the badge of honor. In this case, six men who had nothing to gain from their acts risked their lives for an ideal. Monuments Men did a good job of selling that ideal to me and I bought it whole.SCOTT: The villains in this story are primarily the Germans and the Russians, both of whom want to steal artwork that belongs to others. The Germans especially are cast in an evil light because they prefer to destroy any priceless art that they can t have for themselves. There are countless movies featuring Nazi Germany and Hitler as the villains, and their relentless bloodthirstiness never fails to stir us into hatred for them. But while they are effective villains in this movie, they aren t terribly memorable or noteworthy in any way. The Monuments Men is first and foremost a film about the heroism of an ensemble of men who sacrifice themselves to improve and preserve humanity s artistic contributions to the world. The German villains are largely window dressing whose main role is to challenge our heroes.GREG: You re right about that, Scott. Usually when you have an overwhelming enemy like the Nazis the director will pick one character to represent all of the evil-doers. This gives us one person to identify with as the villain. While there was one Nazi curator who ran off with a ton of art, we hardly see him after the first act. Then there was a scene where Stokes confronts a Nazi head of a concentration camp. But that was just a random bad guy. A good hero needs a good villain and Monuments Men failed to deliver.SCOTT: I somewhat enjoyed The Monuments Men but was disappointed that it fell short of its potential. As I ve noted, the film suffers from too many Hollywood legends in its cast, a tendency to be overly predictable, a somewhat confusing message about sacrificing lives for artwork, and a set of heroes who do not transform themselves during their hero journeys. The Monuments Men is a pretty good movie but certainly not a great one, and so I can only award it 3 Reels out of 5. For reasons stated above, the heroes were clearly heroic but they didn t inspire me with their growth as characters. Because their hero journeys were stunted, I can only give them 2 Heroes out of 5. The villains were certainly villainous -- anyone who destroys priceless Picasso paintings merely because they can t have them themselves is indeed dastardly and barbaric. But the individual villain characters are not developed at all and so the best I can do is award 2 Villains out of 5 for them. Movie: Heroes: Villains: GREG: While I think I enjoyed Monuments Men more than you did, Scott, I give the film the same score. This was a movie that informed more than inspired and it did that fairly well. I didn t know about Hitler s zeal to keep the world s art to himself. And I didn t know about his desire to put it all into a single museum in the heart of Germany or how close we came to losing it all. I also give Monuments Men 3 out of 5 Reels. I liked the heroes in this film but I agree they weren t as strong as some other hero films we ve reviewed. As you point out, there may have been too many stars in this one and not enough story to go around. There is a little bit of a redemption story for Hugh Bonneville s character, but it seemed to be a side dish. And lest we forget the role played by Cate Blanchett as the secretary who kept an itemized list of all the art that went through her museum. The film is full of mini-heroes who just barely add up to 3 out of 5 Heroes. And the villains: cardboard cutouts of movies gone by. Patently evil and uncaring. Dispicable in the face of their failures. There was no opposition here. I give them a blanket 1 Villain out of 5.

"the_monuments_men","One would think that this is a great premise for a great story and a great film, but the problem is that Monuments Men never gets you really interested in any of the characters. They probably should have focused on one German, one American, and perhaps one French or Belgian. Instead, you have a disjointed plot skipping around Europe and you end up caring very little for any of it. Using big name stars only makes you more separated from the characters, the period of time, and the story itself. It would have been much better if they had used good actors little known to the public, or if they are going to use famous actors, shrink the story down to focus on only a few people and develop those characters more. The Train, a great 1964 movie with Burt Lancaster and Paul Scofield, touched on the same subject and did a lot more with a lot less. One detail of the movie that really annoyed me was that they made up the character of Preston Savitz, played by Bob Balaban. This character was based on Lincoln Kirstein, who brought George Balanchine to New York from Russia. Together they later established the New York City Ballet after the war. He was a remarkable enough character on his own to warrant a film. It was his vast knowledge of art that led to him and architect Robert Posey (played by Bill Murray) in finding the Ghent Altarpiece-- the central piece of art in the film. Kirstein was very tall and had very strong features-- very different than Bob Balaban. They should have made the entire film revolve around Lincoln Kirstein-- you would have ended up caring about his character they you would have ended up with a much more engaging and satisfying picture.","20","Drama, Action & Adventure","george clooney|matt damon|bill murray|john goodman|jean dujardin|bob balaban"

"the_monuments_men","9/14/16 I just watched this 2 nights ago, but these reviews need to be done immediately because I already forget my major comments about the film. The story is quit interesting, because it is true, but the film lacks some authenticity. Why in the world does the museum woman who has all this info on what the Nazis did with the art withhold that info? It is pretty obvious that it is done to add drama. It is also difficult to follow where the men are and what the objective of each group is. At one point, they are wandering around an abandoned city, then they are being shot at. Again, I think that was added for dramatic effect. I liked it, but it was hard to tell what they were doing and it was hard to tell when they were successful (or why it was successful).","25","Drama, Action & Adventure","george clooney|matt damon|bill murray|john goodman|jean dujardin|bob balaban"

There are a couple good scenes here - the dinner between Damon and Blanchett and Clooney's faceoff with the Nazi general near the end.

I think the film comes at just the right time when so many baby boomers opine about a return to that gilded age of the 50's when social consciousness was shrink wrapped into little segregate bungalos with shutters closed to hide the ugly truth of how the other side lived. The voice of children in the film spoke the loudest, as they were the real victims of the ignorance fear of the 'other' perpetuated by the adults in the film. The black characters were in the background as were their irrate neighbors, and that's just the way it should be. The voice of the children in the film who in the end found a way to tear down the fences built around them to keep them apart is all we needed to hear.I enjoyed the movie.

It is beautifully filmed, impeccably capturing the plasticky fifties suburban sheen: sweet chromed cars, hair salonned women, and well mannerd interactions. But there is trouble in paradise, and it is ugly.This is a tale of two cities: one in which a black family moves into the neighbourhood and faces the consequences of outlandish racism, and the other which shows a seemingly swell white family beset by tragedy. They are neighbours, and their horrific stories play out side by side. Clooney is smart enough to borrow heavily from the Coen Brothers in filmmaking 101, creating a colourful movie filled with escalating tension, terrific performances, witty dialogue, and several silly moments.Not sure why this has been universally panned. Julianne Moore is perfect in a taxing dual role. Matt Damon shows a new complexity to his previously one-dimensional acting cannon. George Clooney directs a mystery tangle with great aplomb that just looks great.

Suburbicon is not just weird; it's also just plain bad.To describe it would be an act of futility. It's sort of about a family dealing with death. It's sort of about racism. It's sort of a mafia comedy. It's sort of a satire of the American dream. It's sort of a familial thriller. It has some great production design, and Oscar Isaac is a blast in his short screen time. Otherwise, it's one of the most obnoxious critiques of the dark suburban underbelly I've ever seen. I have no idea how someone is supposed to plug into this movie. Predictable when trying to be sneaky, dull when trying to be exciting, awkward when trying to be funny; it gives us no character to latch onto, no story to intrigue us, no humor to overcome its darkness, and no clarity or focus to its themes.Honestly, Mr. Clooney, what is this movie?

"suburbicon","Having just seen The Snowman a mere 10 days ago, I've been thinking about how some movies can be so slapped together. It's a perversely fascinating subject of sorts in my eyes, especially when the talent involved in such films are of ostensibly high caliber, but the same all-to-easy answer always comes to the forefront: a messed up production cycle. When Suburbicon was dumped into theaters a week ago following a nearly non-existence presence at the Venice Film Festival less than two months beforehand, its existence was a non-issue in and of itself. A wacky comedy that was written by one duo and then heavily revised by another duo likely won't make that big of a splash, and such a non-issue existence is pretty fitting to Suburbicon as a movie as well. It's a nothing of a movie despite how much it has going on, a dated, tone-deaf, and incredibly messy story that's executed in broad strokes with no flair at all. In what was originally a script by the Coen brothers and then heavily rewritten by director/producer George Clooney and producer Grant Heslov, Suburbicon tells the story of Gardner Lodge (Matt Damon), husband to Rose (Julianne Moore) and father to Nicky (Noah Jupe) in an idyllic 1959 suburban community. The community just so happens to be called Suburbicon-why else would the movie be called that-and it's rocked when the Meyers-a black family-moves in next door the the family. The Lodges then immediately fall victim to an out-of-nowhere home invasion, after which Rose dies, leading her sister Margaret (also Julianne Moore) to come to stay with them. As law enforcement tries to catch the criminals, supposedly silly hijinks ensue, but none of them make any sense or are even entertaining to watch unfold. There are two main plots here: one about the Meyers and the racism that their new neighbors subject them to; and one regarding the Lodges dealing with the aftermath of a home invasion. These plots and their respective themes are almost completely divorced from each other. All of the surface-level satire on racism feels like an afterthought, and that's because it is; the script apparently had no such material in its earlier iterations. It's difficult to do so much as write about Suburbicon given how flat all of its characters are, their behavior coming off as unfounded and their voices stemming from passé stereotypes that have been wrung out of any substance for the past several decades. The film may or may not have the intention of being an ensemble piece, but that doesn't come across because everything is so messy to begin with. Either way, Gardner is a torturously bland protagonist and Damon's performance does nothing to elevate the material. His white dress shirt makes him look like a blank piece of printer paper, and honestly, the movie could have just had a giant piece of paper be the protagonist and the movie would have as much substance. The situations wherein these characters lay are so obvious and Clooney's direction is so broad that the material comes off as mean-spirited at times and against what the intentions of the filmmakers likely were. The editing precludes any comedic timing and the constantly buoyant tone that Clooney goes for clashes with the inherently dark content of the script; it's like a surgeon taking a sledgehammer to an open-heart surgery appointment. The score by Alexandre Desplat is also damning, being relentless in the worst possible way and suffocating the dialogue and beats in virtually every scene. All of this contributes to the film's handling of racism being the most obnoxious, the joke being on those suffering from constant oppression instead of the idiocy of their oppressors. However, that assumes that there are any real jokes at all, and I don't know that there are. I didn't laugh once throughout the entirety of Suburbicon, and when I wasn't fighting the urge to pass out from disinterest, I was too busy wondering how the people involved could create such a train wreck. It fails entirely in regards to what it aims for, and it also lacks any sort of ironic value. The movie is just sort of... there... while not once being fully present in regards to character, tone, plot, comedy, drama, or satire. The people that I'm guessing are the target audience already know that suburban life thought to be a utopia can be a cesspool of immorality and social injustice, so why waste your breath saying that? Furthermore, why paint it all as silly and outlandish when what's onscreen is more or less happening right now in the real world? Suburbicon doesn't go nearly far enough but has the distaste of something that goes too far. It's not satire. It's just tired. 2.2/10, disastrous, D-, worse than awful, etc.","10","Comedy","matt damon|julianne moore|noah jupe|oscar isaac|glenn fleshler|alex hassell"

"suburbicon","Matt Damon is an excellent actor, but this movie is complete garbage. So bad that I nearly walked out of the theater. Where to start, the plot? It's two main elements fail. Matt Damon's storyline was tedious and predictable, and the other storyline was non-existent with maybe 5 minutes of screen time. They never intersect and just feel out of place together. How about writing? I understand their intention with the movie, but the the theme present was overbearingly forced down your throat. There is no subtlety in the writing, and there ultimately no emotional weight behind the message. Let's move on to acting, it was passable with enjoyable spots here and there. Then they throw a flat character at you and you wonder what you did to deserve this movie. Don't see this movie, even if you have movie pass. It is unbearable and you can't ever get your soul back from this black-hole-succubus-turd movie.","05","Comedy","matt damon|julianne moore|noah jupe|oscar isaac|glenn fleshler|alex hassell"

Now call me crazy but this is completely what is happening in our society today, chasing after a meaningless fear or gossip and allowing the real problem to root itself.

There were subplots that you were waiting to be tied into the main narrative, but it just didn't happen. You could have removed one, saved about 30 minutes, and not affected the viewing experience. Suffice it to say that it's not often I look at my watch in a movie, and was disappointed to see there was still about 20 minutes to go.","10","Comedy","matt damon|julianne moore|noah jupe|oscar isaac|glenn fleshler|alex hassell"

The wife did prepared under cooked chicken, which the employee ate to avoid being offensive. He was fired anyway. Now I know how he felt.","15","Comedy","matt damon|julianne moore|noah jupe|oscar isaac|glenn fleshler|alex hassell"
"suburbicon","No plot or climax. Characters are very flat.","05","Comedy","matt damon|julianne moore|noah jupe|oscar isaac|glenn fleshler|alex hassell"
"suburbicon","George Clooney takes a Coen brothers script and loses his way trying to follow in their footsteps. One thing he misses is the fun mixed with the terrifying or the comedy mixed with the brutality that the Coens have. There aren't many characters to root for and at some point it's just watching scenes go by until it ends. The misstep happens early and often with a cliche of a white neighborhood realizing the new neighbors are black and the way it's handled has been done so many times they could have used footage from another film. Then there's a town meeting with irate citizens at a city council meeting, so over-the-top it's laughable and so heavy-handed it's obviously supposed to be Clooney's interpretation of a Donald Trump rally. By the time the film gets to Matt Damon and his family the unfocused feeling of it all sets in. Matt Damon plays a family man who may or may not owe money to the mob, if why, it's never explained, and he continues to dig a deeper hole for himself to the point that his ineptitude makes it hard to believe he wasn't run over by a bus years ago. His story seems to be the what if a family man owed money to the mob in perfect suburbia? It never really gels with the racist town aspect, and the way both are handled so sloppy makes both storylines fall flat to the point that it seems one idea or the other was a screenplay and the rest was tacked on to make it feature length. An example of how clunky it is is a scene where after most of the families have put up fences to block their view of the black Mayers family, they all hang over the fence and on the front lawn screaming and banging drums. The Mayers' son and Matt Damon's son watch from the basement and the Mayers' kid tells the other boy that 'it goes on all day and night' Problem is the other boy lives next door, so of course he would know the obvious. The two boys are engaging and hopefully can go on to better films. The rest of cast is okay, if not sometimes wasted, Clooney does seem to have tried casting Coen types for the heavys, but doesn't know how to direct them properly. The music by Alexandre Desplat is a high point.","15","Comedy","matt damon|julianne moore|noah jupe|oscar isaac|glenn fleshler|alex hassell"

"movies_101?","Better For Some Harder Questions  One does not expect Cuba Gooding, Jr., to be introspective, and I think one should encourage him when he's willing to do it. Marty Scorsese has told about his childhood asthma often enough so that I can nearly recite along with some of the stories. It is probably worth exploring that Jeff Bridges is inclined toward talking people out of casting him in things and that George Clooney grew up poor as often as not, that his preference for talking about his political views over his personal relationships probably stems from his outspoken father. And I am madly curious which films Kevin Kline made for the money and which directors Jennifer Aniston will never work with again. However, our amiable host seems ill inclined to press the point, or indeed any point whatsoever. I long to take proper film classes some day, but if this man is the best at teaching them, it may not be worth it.  'This man' is Richard Brown, who appears to teach at NYU. He hauls celebrities, mostly actors, in front of a class; the appeal seems to be that he does not tell his students in advance who will be gracing the stage. The only director is Scorsese, leaving aside people like George Clooney who also direct. But since this is the highlight of two seasons of episodes, it's possible that there are more directors in the episodes we don't get. (Wikipedia, to whom I might otherwise turn, is under blackout at the moment.) All but one of the people interviewed in the episodes at hand are very famous indeed; there are Academy Award winners and nominees a-plenty (the Academy's database is not currently returning results; maybe they're doing a work stoppage), and most of the others seem likely to get at least a nomination at some point in the future. And Our Celebrities sit and chat with Richard Brown about their lives and works, fielding some pretty softball questions for our edification.  What I don't get is why one of the 'highlights' of the course is Josh Lucas. I mean, okay, Cuba Gooding, Jr., hasn't had the best career since his Oscar win, which he does explain in some pretty serious detail. (Lesson One: Don't think winning an Oscar means you can do whatever you want.) But he does have that Oscar, and the soul-searching is valuable stuff for anyone looking to get into acting as a career. What's more, I had to look up who Josh Lucas even is, which puts him right out of place among people like Daniel Day-Lewis and Whoopi Goldberg. He was also so boring that his was the only episode I didn't even actually finish, so it can't be that he had such deeply fascinating things to say. When the great work your host is interviewing someone about is the remake of [i]The Poseidon Adventure[/i], you might want to consider that the guest hasn't done much worth talking about. So I'm a little confused by that, and it's definitely the weakest spot in the collection.  However, I'm quite serious that the pieces are softballs. Asking Jennifer Connelly how she met her husband and what she thought of him on the set of [i]A Beautiful Mind[/i] is the sort of thing you should leave to [i]People Magazine[/i] puff pieces, not a serious interview in front of a film class. If you're going to have her there, why not ask her about working with Muppets? That's what most of your audience really wants to know about. Make Jon Voight actually tell you who the person considered first for Joe Buck in [i]Midnight Cowboy[/i] was! Oh, I know these people all want to work some more, but is it really going to destroy Julianne Moore's career if she names a few names? Have Willem Dafoe compare himself directly to various of his costars if he's going to start making comparisons. I mean, Richard Dreyfuss was willing to tell Nathan Rabin exactly what he thinks of Oliver Stone for the [i]My Year of Flops[/i] book. If you're making a show of having these people for your classes, really draw out the teaching moments.  Do I think an interview with Dennis Quaid is essential? No. Susan Sarandon and Sigourney Weaver, possibly. But I think calling this 'The Essential Interviews,' as the DVD set does, is forcing the issue quite a bit. Though to be perfectly honest, I don't think any interview is essential when it comes to teaching film school. There are essential films to watch, but I think there's more to learn from them than from listening to the stories of the people who made them. I also don't think talking to any of those people is any more essential than talking to anyone else who made the movies. Does talking to Jeff Bridges tell you more about [i]The Fisher King[/i] than talking to Terry Gilliam--or Robin Williams? Or, indeed, any one of a number of people whose names most people don't know? I know someone who thinks going to film school is all that it takes to be someone who will change the world of film; I think perhaps the person she needs to hear interviewed is the second associate producer or something pettier still.","30","Documentary, Special Interest","cuba gooding jr.|jeff bridges|jennifer aniston|jennifer connelly|jon voight|julianne moore"
