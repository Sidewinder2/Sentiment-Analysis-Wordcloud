"the_source_the_story_of_the_beats_and_the_beat_generation_1999","A pretty lively and entertaining look at how three writers (Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs) and their friends changed the cultural landscape of America from the conservatism of the 1950's to the spiritual revolution of counterculture in the 1960's and changed the way we look at art, politics, war, etc. forever. It is also quite refreshing to have three famous actors reading passages from the works of these men over the footage and interviews with those who participated in the Beat Generation's revolution of culture.","40","Documentary, Musical & Performing Arts, Classics, Comedy, Special Interest","johnny depp|dennis hopper|john turturro|neal cassady|norman mailer"

Depp conveys the emotion in Barker's character so well, and while there is humor littered throughout the dialogue, the story itself is extremely tragic and drains you of your emotions when you see these characters' backstories and their hopes and dreams for the future.

"sweeney_todd_the_demon_barber_of_fleet_street_2007","One of the main accusations about Tim Burton is that he has essentially made the same film for more than thirty years. Burton's status as a latter-day auteur, with a distinctive visual style and approach to storytelling, has frequently left him open to the criticism that he is repeating himself. 'Burtonian' may not be as widespread an adjective as Kubrickian, Lynchian or Hitchcockian, but it comes with both the same pressure to live up to early promise and the same pitfalls of focussing on style at the expense of substance - a peril I discussed at length in my review of Wild at Heart.It cannot be denied that Burton has had moments in his career where his heart just hasn't been in it - usually when he has wandered out of his Gothic comfort zone to make a quick buck, as was the case with Mars Attacks! and Planet of the Apes. But between the latter and the calamity that was Alice in Wonderland, Burton hit a purple patch with three films which reiterated just what a creative genius he can be at his best. Having set the bar high with Big Fish and followed it up splendidly with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, he then delivered this film, which sits comfortably alongside Ed Wood as the crowning glory of his career.If nothing else is true about Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (Sweeney Todd hereafter), it is a fantastic riposte to the notion that Burton had somehow grown soft and sentimental in his middle age. This was always a rather rich comment, given that some of his earlier work, like Batman Returns, had been (unfairly) criticised for being too dark and cold. But for those who found Big Fish too cheerful, this is the perfect antidote, returning us to the grim, dark world, at once oppressive and fantastic, that Burton has made his own.When Mark Kermode reviewed the film on BBC Radio 5 Live, he described it as 'the flipside of Edward Scissorhands', talking about how the look and manner of Johnny Depp's performance was a twisted inversion of that film's protagonist, turning Edward's innocent harming of those he loved into a conscious murderous crusade. There are also huge similarities in approach to Sleepy Hollow, not only with the 18-certificate violence but the emphasis on period detail and a community feeding on itself (quite literally, of course).The story of Sweeney Todd is one of the hardiest in English literature, with its origins stretching back to the penny dreadfuls of Charles Dickens' day and the early fallout of the Industrial Revolution. As British cities rapidly expanded as people flocked from the countryside, public fears abounded about rising crime and unscrupulous business practices - including the means by which food was now being manufactured. The first appearance of Benjamin Barker, in 1846's The String of Pearls, married the fear of cannibalism to barbers of the day serving as surgeons - the red and white poles outside barbers' shops symbolised the blood and bandages of their secondary trade.Burton sets out his intentions for Sweeney Todd in the elaborate opening credits, demonstrating both his fidelity to Stephen Sondheim's musical and his intrinsic understanding of its themes and tone. The mixing of blood and water, first in the clouds and finally in the sewers, is a brilliant visual metaphor for the way in which violence and vengeance contaminate everything they touch. Sondheim's overture, at once brooding and hysterical, puts us right in the edgy mood required for the plot to have impact, so that the second that Depp appears on screen, we feel intimidated.Perhaps no film since Get Carter (or possibly The Last House on the Left) has so perfectly captured the self-destructive nature of revenge - how those bent on vengeance end up becoming consumed by their own misguided obsession. The initial telling of Lucy's apparent demise leads us to sympathise (at least somewhat) with Sweeney's plight, but by the time he has killed for the first time he has already crossed over into darkness. Eventually he becomes so fixated on killing Judge Turpin that he doesn't even recognise the woman he loved, slitting her throat without saying a word to her. Burton's rendering of both her death and Sweeney's are both graphic and beautiful, using their blood in a manner that would make Dario Argento proud.The film is also interested in the complicity of all society in Sweeney's schemes, either by their direct involvement (Mrs Lovett and Toby) or their failure to intervene and stop him. One of the central lines comes outside the Old Bailey, when Judge Turpin asks Beadle Bamford whether the boy he just sentenced to death was guilty. Bamford mutters, 'Well if he didn't do it, he had surely done something to warrant the hanging', to which Turpin replies, 'What man has not?'. What sounds like a platitude out of context is actually a telling remark on how society feeds on itself with no real regard for right and wrong - a theme later reflected in the song 'A Little Priest'.This brings us on to the singing, one of the main bones of contention among fans of the original musical. If you are expecting the actors to sing with the rounded, showy polish exhibited on Broadway or the West End (the kind of performance that always looks rubbish on film), then you will be disappointed. But while the tone of the piece is decidedly operatic - all big emotions and hearts worn on sleeves - the subject matter lends itself to a rougher, more angular style of delivery. Depp and Helena Bonham Carter sing very well, and the fact that they don't sound like naturally rounded singers works entirely to their benefit.The supporting cast beyond Depp and Carter is also really strong. The late Alan Rickman is perfectly cast as Judge Turpin, a part which, like Hans Gruber in Die Hard, is at turns darkly funny and deeply threatening. He sings like a deep bassoon and relishes being lecherous without ever over-playing it. Timothy Spall, who previously proved his singing credentials in Topsy-Turvy, struts through his part like a proud toad, again striking a balance between comedy and intimidation. And Sacha Baron Cohen, fresh off the back of Borat, gives one of his finest performances as Adolfo Pirelli; he's so charmingly ridiculous that he almost steals the show.Sweeney Todd also succeeds in marrying Sondheim's darkly comic lyrics to Burton's distinctive visual imagery. The cramped and dank streets of London are like the corrupted, industrialised descendants of Sleepy Hollow, and Dariusz Wolski (who shot Dark City) brings out the deep reds and sharp silvers to create a world which is both gruesome and painstakingly beautiful. The city seems to stretch forever, like a nightmarish labyrinth with Sweeney and Mrs Lovett as its Minotaurs, while the seaside scene hilariously juxtaposes Burton's designs with a sugary setting. Best of all is the closing scene, which borrows from The Third Man and the 'Acid Queen' sequence in Ken Russell's Tommy to conjure up a truly masterful climax.Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a stupendous triumph of a film, which both honours its source material and brings a unique approach to a well-worn story. Burton's storytelling and direction are absolutely superb, bringing out the rich, murky substance of the story while never neglecting its dark sense of humour. The visuals are stunning and the gore is wonderfully executed (ha ha), but we also care deeply about the characters. It is easily Burton's best film since Ed Wood, and ten years on it remains essential viewing.","50","Drama, Musical & Performing Arts, Mystery & Suspense","johnny depp|helena bonham carter|alan rickman|timothy spall|sacha baron cohen|jamie campbell bower"
"sweeney_todd_the_demon_barber_of_fleet_street_2007","Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is directed by Tim Burton, and it stars Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, and Alan Rickman in a musical horror about an English barber that's looking for his wife after being rescued, and when he realized about what happened to her, he wants to get vengeance on a judge who Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) away while Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) took Benjamin's wife and daughter. When I first watched it, I loved it and pretty much gave it a five-star rating in this without giving any explanation why. So when I finished whatever I watched on Netflix, I couldn't think of another film to watch, despite my list being big. So I decided to rewatch this just so I can take it off my list, and I still enjoyed it very much. Johnny Depp is terrific in this for his devious manner wise, and while his singing voice is not the best compared to other actors that have experience with singing, knowing that he's been training for this role and giving what he has given with this, it's a really good voice that fits the character. The other actors are great too from Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman, or even a supporting cameo from Sachs Baron Cohen. When it comes down to songs, it really does come down to my personal taste as there can be some songs in musical movie adaptations that I'm not a fan of, but people like those songs, but for me in this, almost all, or everyone, of them are enjoyable and catchy to listen to by Stephen Sondheim. The characters are memorable to watch, and the writing by John Logan is very tight that it didn't felt like there were some shortcomings that were long in the musical, but not so much in the film. The story is really interesting to watch, and how the character changes himself makes you understand why he's going through a transition, and you just felt sorry for him. It's a lot of fun to watch, and it just seem to be my type of film to keep rewatching for a while. Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a fantastically adapted musical that this is one of the best musicals that I've seen.","50","Drama, Musical & Performing Arts, Mystery & Suspense","johnny depp|helena bonham carter|alan rickman|timothy spall|sacha baron cohen|jamie campbell bower"

"sweeney_todd_the_demon_barber_of_fleet_street_2007","When my wife warned me that this was a musical, I will admit that my curiosity was piqued. I was ready for something different, and a dark, gritty musical sounded like it could fit that bill. Unfortunately, the musical aspect overstayed its welcome for me. Trying to walk the tight rope between edgy and comedic, Todd falls short as its tone wavers all over the place. This tale of revenge and woe clashes with the over-the-top murders that are performed night after night for little reason other than to cement the inhumane character of Todd. It is difficult to feel anything for the main character as his emotional spectrum seldom deviates from simmering moodiness. As for the tale itself, it hums a good tune, hits a few interesting bars, but ultimately fails to live up to potential. It even fails to resolve some of its most important plot elements that allows the plot to move along at all.","25","Drama, Musical & Performing Arts, Mystery & Suspense","johnny depp|helena bonham carter|alan rickman|timothy spall|sacha baron cohen|jamie campbell bower"

"sweeney_todd_the_demon_barber_of_fleet_street_2007","A magnificent achievement for director Tim Burton, 'Sweeney Todd' is a bold and disturbing musical that stars Johnny Depp as the title character with a supporting cast to the likes of Helena Bonham Carter and Alan Rickman. As another take on this musical, Burton's adaption includes an impressive control of cinematography along with highly entertaining song numbers and thrilling violence. 'Sweeney Todd' tells the gory tale of a barber who seeks revenge on the judge who took his wife and daughter away and locked him in prison. When Todd gets out, he sets out to kill the judge and pretty much anybody who gets in his way. Todd's partner-in-crime, Mrs. Lovett (Bonham Carter) not only helps him, but decides to 'beef' up her homemade pies by cooking in the human flesh of the people Todd kills. The two begin a twisted business-relationship as they try to lure the judge in to get his beard trimmed and will kill him then.There is a lot of bloodshed in this adaptation and sometimes the musical numbers seem to awkwardly start and end, but it's a beautifully dark film that should keep musical lovers happy as well as entertaining those who aren't. Seriously, even if you're generally not a fan of musicals, don't let that stop you.

"sweeney_todd_the_demon_barber_of_fleet_street_2007","Do serial kills start singing after they murder their victims? Most likely not, but Sweeney Todd tackles that very premise as Tim Burton directs his bloodiest film to date.When musicals are done right, I'll be one of the first in line to see them. Much like Westerns, they are rare to come by these days so I'm always down to go back and check out one that I hadn't previously seen. Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street was one of those musicals, but sadly I don't think it lived up to the hype for me.To have a cohesive character arc, you need obstacles or just something significant a character goes through so that the ending feels justified and earned. In my opinion, there is no real character arc for Todd. Sure, he begins as a normal man starting a life with his wife and daughter, but this is done in a brief flashback. I never once felt attached to this character or really cared at all. The wrongs that were done to him and his family are bad, but again, it wasn't like we see a lot of this on screen, we are told about it. For as much bad as we see Todd do, it just would have been nice to have some material balance it out the other way.As for the musical aspects go, it's pretty paint by numbers. Perhaps, if I were into the story a little bit more and cared about what the characters were doing, I would have gotten into the songs they were singing. I really tried, but I just couldn't. It's also worth noting that because this film does have a fair amount of dialogue as well, the transitions to song weren't as smooth as they could have been. I love me some Alan Rickman, but when he breaks out into song at the barbershop, it feels pretty dang awkward.I'm in the minority here though, this musical is beloved by many people, and at first glance it seems like Burton did a nice job of adapting the musical to screen. So perhaps it's just me. I just feel that in order to make a good film about someone who says 'we'll not discriminate who we kill', I have to believe that what he or she is doing is warranted, and I didn't. Of course, these aren't just regular murders. These are bloody and premeditated murders in which the victims get baked into pies and fed to the town. Brutal. Just brutal.+Burton was the right man for the job-Never felt connected to the story or characters-Pretty gratuitous if you ask me-Song transitions are rough4.5/10","20","Drama, Musical & Performing Arts, Mystery & Suspense","johnny depp|helena bonham carter|alan rickman|timothy spall|sacha baron cohen|jamie campbell bower"

"charlie_and_the_chocolate_factory","I remember seeing Charlie and the Chocolate Factory on TV when I was 10 years old. Not really giving a crap about the Gene Wilder movie at the time, I was enthralled by what it had to offer, sparking my interest in Tim Burton for the first time despite having previously seen his version of Alice in Wonderland. And it also made me want to read Roald Dahl's books and I read most, if not all, of his children's books. Looking back on this movie now, I still don't think it's, by any means, terrible. People are just blinded by nostalgia and I think they were expecting a remake of the Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory. I admit its not a true classic unlike its 1971 counterpart and the Oompa Loompa songs are fun albeit forgettable. Johnny Depp's no Wilder either. However, I still like this film thanks to Tim Burton's trademark stunning visuals, increased faithfulness to its source material compared to the classic movie that Dahl hated, Danny Elfman's score and dark tone. Come on, people, I hear dark Chocolate has half a dozen + 1 healthy benefits. Freddie Highmore is cute playing Charlie. Whatever happened to him? Famous child actors such as Highmore and Dakota Fanning never appear on the big screen anymore. If the Chocolate Factory were an amusement park, then I'd be more than willing to pay the price of admission. The Glass Elevator looks awesome. So yeah. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory may not have the charm of the 1971 classic but its visuals, score and Burton's 'Pure Imagination' make it an entertaining diversion for anyone who enjoys dark Chocolate and are more into stories that are faithful to their source material.","40","Kids & Family, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Comedy","johnny depp|freddie highmore|david kelly|helena bonham carter|noah taylor|missi pyle"

"charlie_and_the_chocolate_factory","Charlie and the Chocolate Factory isn't a terrible film. It has bad qualities, but it has good ones as well. Burton's vision ruins the tone of the film, but it's undeniably fun to watch. The screenplay for the rest of the actors isn't terrible, but Burton tries too hard to make the film darker and appealing to the adults in the audience and forgets all about what the main market is: the kids. And I don't know what the screenwriters were thinking when they wrote Johnny Depp's lines, but they failed miserably at whatever they were trying to accomplish. The story is closer to the source material than the 1971 adaptation of the novel.

"charlie_and_the_chocolate_factory","Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is directed by Tim Burton, and it stars Johnny Depp and Freddie Highmore in a musical fantasy film about Wily Wonka giving 5 golden tickets to random kids to go to his factory for a tour. I haven't watched this in a while, and since I reviewed the original, I figured I should just get it over with and see how it holds up, which the remake actually does, for the most part that is. The acting from the kids and their parents are pretty solid, and the effects look better than the original. It has some differences in there from the original, whether they're good or bad. The songs by Danny Elfman are catchy and memorable, although nothing beats the original with the songs. The production designs look creative and imaginative, and it does a good job of portraying the financially unstable family that tries to make the best of the situation. Now, let's get to Johnny Depp's performance. People are either loathing it, or just find it enjoyable to watch. I get why the movie portrayed him as that way because he's a man-child that had family problems which caused him to act that way. For my own opinion on this, the only time he did shined in this and actually give a good performance, is the last 5 minutes of the film where he can still act like a man-child, while not being awkward about it. During the film when he's in it however, he's so awkward in it that I'm just not liking what he's doing in his act, and it's not funny, except for a chuckle here or there from him doing something off-base. In something like the original, Gene Wilder basically acted like a bit of a sociopath when messing with the kids, and it's hilarious to watch, so when comparing to the remake, being a man-child doesn't really make a good substitute for it. I didn't really care for the fact that it was more about Willy Wonka than Charlie despite the fact that his name is in the title, and what they developed in there, was ok, but not really needed. The Oompa-Loompas don't look as memorable in this as the original does, even though the actor did a good job being all of them. I like the child characters in there as they are dislikable, but not to the point that it's too much as you can see that that's how they were raised. What I didn't like however, was that Charlie himself is too likable in this. When in the original, he has some disadvantages to himself that makes him more relatable and give it more of a thought about who's going to win. With this however, he doesn't do one wrong thing and it seem more obvious and predictable that way, making him a one-note character. I don't know, maybe it should've been a bit more similar to the original where it doesn't spend any character development on Wonka as we like to imagine what he's like, and not also know where the Oompa-Loompas come from. I still do like the movie more than I thought of it based on Tim Burton's adaptations from remakes and TV shows, but compared to the original, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory isn't as good as Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.","35","Kids & Family, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Comedy","johnny depp|freddie highmore|david kelly|helena bonham carter|noah taylor|missi pyle"

"charlie_and_the_chocolate_factory","The sad death of Gene Wilder earlier this year saw not only an outpouring of tributes but a re-examination of his work. The cult status of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, and Wilder's performance therein, has swelled over the the last 45 years to the point where the film has become a lynchpin among classic children's films, like Mary Poppins before it. For some people, Wilder will always be Willy Wonka, and no-one could ever hope to equal him, let along exceed him.In the face of such a popular performance, not to mention the other memorable aspects of Mel Stuart's film, you wouldn't think that any remake would have stood a chance. Tim Burton's only previous attempt at a remake - Planet of the Apes - had tarnished his reputation badly, and while he had redeemed himself with Big Fish, there were still big question marks over his treatment of beloved source materials. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (Charlie hereafter) is now 11 years old, and like its predecessor it may take another few decades for audiences to properly appreciate its qualities. But even this far out, it is a great adaptation which, if anything, is more faithful to the book and closer to the spirit of what Roald Dahl wanted to get across.Like Burton's Batman, Charlie took a long time to make it to the screen. Dahl had disowned the original film due to the changes made to his screenplay, and the producers' refusal to cast the late Spike Milligan as Willy Wonka. In light of this, Dahl refused to release the rights to the sequel, Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator, and after his death in 1990 his estate became increasingly guarded about adaptations of his work.Out of Sight screenwriter Scott Frank and future director of The Hunger Games Gary Ross came close to getting the green light in February 2000, but both left the project 18 months and several rewrites later. Martin Scorsese was fleetingly tipped to take over before he chose to make The Aviator, and there was even talk of Ace Ventura: Pet Detective director Tom Shadyac taking the reins with Jim Carrey as Willy Wonka - a prospect thankfully vetoed by the Dahl estate. Burton finally got the job in 2003, bringing with him Big Fish screenwriter John August; Dahl's widow Felicity had been impressed by Burton's work as a producer on Henry Selick's version of James and the Giant Peach, and the pair bonded over their mutual dislike for the original adaptation.The first thing that Charlie gets right is the way that it looks. Despite having a decent colour palette, Stuart's film looks for all the world like a TV movie: with the exception of the famously terrifying tunnel sequence - the only truly great scene in the film - every scene feels small and hemmed in, as though the 'pure imagination' could only be seen from a certain angle. From the outset, with a typically elaborate opening credit sequence, you feel like you're in an extraordinarily creative and yet gruesome world, with magic lurking in even the tiniest item on show. There's still an intimacy to it, thanks to both the performers and Danny Elfman's score, but there's much more of a wow factor (or yuk factor) to both the set-pieces and the journeys between them.Much like James, Charlie wrestles with the need to adapt a very British story in a way that American audiences would understand. In this respect at least, Burton deserves credit for not straying too far from the source; while Selick's creative choices on James did work well, some viewers weren't all that happy with the mechanical shark, the pirate crew or not seeing the terrifying Cloudmen from book. Unlike a lot of American directors, Burton resists making the British scenes unbelievably twee and touristy; by rooting the look of his film in the fantastical (for instance, siting a tumbledown thatched cottage right near a towering factory), the project retains an international flavour which compliments the characterisation and makes its themes easier to translate.Charlie nails both the themes and spirit of the original story in a way that the previous version simply didn't manage. The book is, at its heart, a warning about materialistic excess and greed, using the Western world's slavering desire to consume chocolate as a cautionary tale of how modern society makes us lose sight of the most important things in life. Grandpa George's illuminating deconstruction of money is just as effective in this regard as the montages of the various searches for the golden tickets. Burton brilliantly contrasts the soulness, empty actions by which the other children find their tickets (ripping bars off the shelves, employing factory workers, hacking the delivery system or just eating yourself sick) with the special, personal joy experienced by Charlie. The film rises above mere sentimentality and captures that childlike sense of ecstasy so very well.This brings us to one of Burton's more controversial decisions, namely the backstory invoving Willy Wonka's father. Making him a dentist is a natural choice, and Christopher Lee is as good here as he was in his all-too-brief role in Sleepy Hollow. But it does pivot back to James, and the debate about fidelity to the book as a means of judging the film's success. Dahl's main complaint about the original was that it focussed too much on Wonka and too little on Charlie. The remake does better, but it can't help pivoting back to Wonka in the later stages as the unfinished business with his father is resolved.Notwithstanding the obvious fact that being faithful to the source is no guarantee of quality (cf. the first two Harry Potter films), the introduction of Wonka's backstory actually adds to the character. Wonka in both the books is an elusive figure, with Charlie being the only other person able to get onto his wavelight; he doesn't deliberately withhold information or lie to the other protagonists, but you always sense that there's more going on in his head than he's letting on. In other hands the backstory chosen by August would seem pat and perfunctory, but Burton plays it very carefully to illuminate one of Wonka's main contradictions: he is simultaneously a rebellious free spirit, who hates rules and responsibilities, and someone who is very guarded, serious and principled on matters of the heart - including his family, whether biological or, in the case of Charlie, adopted.This combination of guardedness and wacky creativity is captured beautifully in Johnny Depp's performance. Comparisons with Michael Jackson are largely superficial, with critics of the time focussing too much on the make-up and not enough on the demons lurking beneath the childlike smile and giggle. As Burton observed, the character is much closer to Howard Hughes (making Scorsese's involvement in the project rather ironic). Beyond the skintight gloves and fear of human contact, Wonka reflects Hughes' obsession with his work, his consternation over the tiniest details, the variety of his talents and his paralysing fear of death and ageing. The scene with the grey hair is beautifully played by Depp as both a wry dig at modern psychiatry and a genuine moment of existential terror.Depp's performance is also balanced out nicely by the rest of the ensemble. Freddie Highmore may be more overtly fresh-faced than his 1971 counterpart Peter Ostrum, but he resists playing him simply as a goody-two-shoes; his more emotional moments don't come across as mawkish, and he enjoys a strong bond with Depp (with whom he previously worked on Finding Neverland). Noah Taylor and Helena Bonham-Carter are a good fit for Charlie's parents, and David Kelly (best known for his work on Fawlty Towers) is a standout as Grandpa Joe. Credit should also go to the underrated Missi Pyle, who makes Violet's mother more interesting than she is in the book, and the endlessly duplicated (and eternally patient) Deep Roy, who plays every last one of the Oompa-Loompas.The only fly in the chocolate with Charlie is its music - or more specifically, its songs. They may replicate the lyrics from Dahl's book, but the sound mixing is atrocious: even after several watches to pick up all the misheard words, the mix feels needlessly crowded and chaotic. Burton doesn't have a tin ear for music - as he would subsequently prove with Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street - but he is surprisingly awkward and clueless about how to integrate these moments into the plot. Likewise the sequence outside Wonka's factory featuring the melting puppets is either a failed nonsequitur or just a waste of time; it has no reason to be there, serves no purpose in the plot, and robs Depp of the distinctive entrance he deserves.In spite of its musical stumbles, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a great adaptation which is both more faithful to the original story and more completely rewarding than the Mel Stuart version. Burton uses the familiar territory to his advantage, giving Dahl's tale a timeless quality and registers emotional depth where others would have merely settled for sentimentality. It may never win over fans of the Wilder version - including Wilder himself - but it remains a compelling adaptation with warmth and subtlety to spare.","45","Kids & Family, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Comedy","johnny depp|freddie highmore|david kelly|helena bonham carter|noah taylor|missi pyle"

"corpse_bride","Corpse Bride (2005) is Tim Burton's second stop motion feature and the first one that he actually directed himself along with help from Mike Johnson. I've been hearing many of my friends talk about this film whenever the subject of Tim Burton is brought up and they all seem praise it so much. I on the other hand don't quite see it the same way but even with that, This movie was definitely very good to check out.The Story does feel like a Burton flick in how he incorporates his gothic themes and his unusual style of humor. Most importantly it contains a lot of heart which I always admire. The overall feel is very calm and depressing except in the moments when the fun energy needs to be added which works great to the movie's advantage. The ideas are well explored and taken advantage of especially when we explore the mysterious Land of the dead. Even though it seems everything is in it's place my only big problem was the last minute villain as it felt kinda rushed in and could have been better explained. The Characters definitely give this movie great charm and the voice actors really help incorporate personality to bring Burton's vision to life. I might not be a huge Johnny Depp fan but Victor was a really charming character and I definitely felt bad for him for all the situations he always gets himself into. Emily is also a very sympathetic character as her tragic past along with her misunderstanding really brings emotional depth to her character. Victoria May not have too much character but the time she spends with Victor is endearing and lovely. The side characters in the living world are portrayed as soulless and grim (In the Best way) while the side characters in the Dead are full of personality as well as energy. The only character I felt was kinda out of place was Barkis. His role was kinda out of nowhere and I didn't think he had enough personality for being the antagonist.The Animation is too gorgeous for words, It has Tim Burton's fingerprints all over it. The character designs really stick out as they feel like something Burton drawn first and then turned into puppets. The characters in the living are very formal and have very grayish looking faces as well as oddly shaped bodies. The characters in the dead meanwhile are creatively designed and more colorful compared to the living. The Backgrounds are also same with the Living world being dull and ugly while the Dead World has vivid colors and creepy surprises. It's probably some of the best animation i've seen from Burton so far.The Music is of course done by Danny Elfman. He's practically done almost all of Tim Burton's films so it definitely was great for him to do this one as well. His Orchestral work is definitely effective in the slower scenes and made even better whenever he incorporates the organ into the creepier moments. There are also some songs he wrote for the film that work quite good. I personally don't think these are the most memorable in his catalog but they are still fun to listen to and they do work great when it comes to the characters expressing their feelings.I wouldn't put this movie up their with movies like 'Edward Scissorhands' or 'The Nightmare before Christmas' but this movie is still a really good effort from Tim Burton and I always look forward to watching this movie every Halloween. I don't think it's the best out of his catalog but it definitely is still one heck of a spooky joyride (A-)","40","Action & Adventure, Animation, Kids & Family, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Comedy","johnny depp|helena bonham carter|emily watson|tracey ullman|paul whitehouse|joanna lumley"

The music and visuals pair together to create unique moods, while also remaining catchy and beautiful, with those adjectives applying to their respective media categories.

"corpse_bride","Corpse Bride is a heartfelt and funny animated film that embraces Burton's weirdness and creates a well-told story. The film has issues, but the final product is more than enjoyable. The writing is average. It isn't anything above, or below that. It get's the job done, and nothing but that. It isn't amazing nor terrible, and it works along with the animation to create one helluva story. In addition, the music is very well done. The collaboration between Burton and Danny Elfman is, yet again, spectacular. Many complain about Burton working with the same people over and over again, but let's be real for a moment here: Has there been a single time when Elfman's scores have disappointed? Didn't think so. Even Depp and Carter are great in their roles here, and the voice acting is great.","40","Action & Adventure, Animation, Kids & Family, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Comedy","johnny depp|helena bonham carter|emily watson|tracey ullman|paul whitehouse|joanna lumley"

"corpse_bride","'The Corpse Bride' is Tim Burton's twist on arranged marriage and the desire to marry for love, not obligation. Out of the selfish interests of their parents, it has been arranged for Victor and Victoria to wed. Both families think that by marrying into the other family, there will be financial benefits. While the children are against the arrangement at first, they grow to admire each other after meeting. Victor's nerves lead him to the woods to practice his vows before the big day. Mistaking a corpse's hand for a tree branch, Victor accidentally proposes to Emily. Murdered by Barkis Bittern and robbed of her possessions, after she had eloped with him against her parent's wishes, Emily was waiting in the underworld for her true love. Just as Victoria and Victor's parents, Barkis did not think one should marry for love- he was motivated by greed and now he was after Victoria. Emily fell for Victor, but he could not love her the same way because of their differences. For Victor to marry Emily, he would have to leave his family forever and join death in the underworld. By the end of the movie Emily lets Victor and Victoria marry because she realizes the love they have for one another.","35","Action & Adventure, Animation, Kids & Family, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Comedy","johnny depp|helena bonham carter|emily watson|tracey ullman|paul whitehouse|joanna lumley"
"corpse_bride","'Corpse Bride' (2005) is a movie that will have your eyes constantly popping out of your head with amazement, similar to how the Corpse Bride's (Helena Bonham Carter) eyes constantly pop out of her own head during the movie. Director Tim Burton never fails to leave his audiences in awe with the fantastical nature of his films. With the incredible Expressionistic animation and hyperbolic appearances of the characters, the audience can't help but be engaged in the movie's exciting flow of the events. This film features Johnny Depp as Victor Van Dort and Emily Watson as Victory Everglot. Knowing Johnny Depp has any connection to a movie is already a good sign. It is the perfect movie to watch if you enjoy horror, comedy, and/or romance- Yes, this movie has it all! The film presents a depiction of the world that will not only have you reevaluating your daily life, but will also have you 'die' laughing at its humor. This movie is perfect for getting you into the Halloween spirit, but is honestly enjoyable anytime of the year.

"corpse_bride","'The Corpse Bride' (Tim Burton, 2005) is not like the typical romantic Halloween movie because the way the main characters get their happy ending is unexpected. Victor Van Dort, (Johnny Depp) attains his happy ending through his marriage with Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson), while the Corpse Bride (Helena Bonham Carter) gains her happy ending through sacrificing herself. Before one even watches the movie, it can be expected that 'The Corpse Bride' will have elements of creativity, irony, and humor because of Burton's previous works such as 'Frankenweenie' (1984), 'Pee-Wee's Big Adventure' (1985), and 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' (1993), all of which received high ratings. The biggest overarching style of 'The Corpse Bride' is Burton's use of expressionism. Chiaroscruro, the use of light and shade, is used throughout the movie to exaggerate the creepy mood of the film. To align the film with the expressionist style, character designers such as Carles Burges, drew the characters with jagged, distorted lines with very little color. Victor Van Dort is portrayed as a tall, pale, and bony character with very heavy shadows under his eyes. All of the characters in the movie are portrayed in a similar way. Like many Halloween movies, Burton's 'Corpse Bride' displays the world of the dead as a lively and fun world. There are multiple luminescent colors used in the world of the dead, in contrast to the dark and gloomy world of the living. Even if you are not a big fan of it, this film will help you to appreciate Halloween a little more because of the light and humor the characters bring to the screen. The 'Corpse Bride' is a light hearted, easy movie to watch and I would highly recommend it as a family movie.","40","Action & Adventure, Animation, Kids & Family, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Comedy","johnny depp|helena bonham carter|emily watson|tracey ullman|paul whitehouse|joanna lumley"
"corpse_bride","Tim Burton spooks us all again, this time in his animated film 'Corpse Bride' (2005). Using stop-motion-animation, this film includes all the elements of a classic Tim Burton cinematic experience: music, heavy make-up, dark scenery, Johnny Depp, and Helena Bonham Carter. Depp and Carter work flawlessly together as the voices of the main characters Victor and his corpse bride, Emily. This is not surprising, since they have appeared together in almost every movie produced by Burton in the past few decades. Joining them is Emily Watson, who plays Victor's fianc�e, Victoria. After a rehearsal wedding gone awry, Emily pulls Victor into the world of the dead! Terrified, Victor's only goal is to return to his true love Victoria, in the world of the living. The tale that follows is harrowed with love, deception, passion, betrayal, joy, and sorrow. Burton provides us with a world in which the dead are more alive than the living. The gothic, twisted features sported by the many characters, as well as the spiraling, Victorian settings are faintly unsettling, and add to the overall effect. The film is aimed for a young audience, however, this musical extravaganza is one that anyone will enjoy!","50","Action & Adventure, Animation, Kids & Family, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Comedy","johnny depp|helena bonham carter|emily watson|tracey ullman|paul whitehouse|joanna lumley"
"corpse_bride","Don't let the title, Corpse Bride (Tim Burton 2005), turn you away; this animated work of art is an emotional and entertaining story. Burton (known for Edward Scissorhands (1990) and The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) ) really knows how to make his audience connect with even the strangest of characters.

This film will put you on an emotional rollercoaster as your travel from the colorful land of the dead to the dark world of the living.

"corpse_bride","Over ten years ago marked the release of Tim Burton's Corpse Bride, and while many people rank it among his absolute best films, I am here to discuss why I believe it falls nicely in the middle. When it comes to Tim Burton films, they can be very hit or miss for me. From amazing films like Edward Scissorhands or Ed Wood, to downright awful productions in either 2001's Planet of the Apes or the luke-warm reboot in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Some fans go crazy when he announces a new film, but I have had to see for myself upon every one of his releases. He is a very talented director that decides to go a little too bizarre at times. That being said, Corpse Bride was, and still remains one of his greats.Following Victor, an introverted groom-to-be, as he practices his vows on the night before he is to be married, he accidentally practices on a rotting corpse in the woods. Thinking she is his wife, the corpse rises from her grave and begins to act as though they are married, thus upsetting his bride-to-be. This premise is original in every sense of the word, even by standards set by many of Burton's films of the past. Exploring stop-motion animation through Laika studios before they became as well known as they are today, this technology was masterful for its time and has only improved with age. There is absolutely nothing ordinary about this delightfully whimsical animated film.With films like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory or Alice in Wonderland, Tim Burton has proven that he may go a little too far when it comes to crazy visuals, but then again, people love having his stamp on certain projects. For me, when you stylize your film it becomes your own, but there is only so much you can do before it becomes a cluster of visuals, set in motion by a director who cannot control him or herself. Corpse Bride teeters on the edge of being a little too 'Tim Burtony' (for lack of a better term) in my opinion. From its dark tone, to its voice cast, to its bizarre narrative style, everything about this picture screams Burton. In my opinion, it does slightly harm the overall film.While I do not believe a director should hold back on their vision of a film, there does come a time when style over substance takes away from the core story. Corpse Bride does go all out in a few scenes and I found myself enjoying the visuals more than what had been happening in certain scenes. That being said, the story is loveable enough to distract you from becoming too distracted. An auteur filmmaker can do whatever he/she pleases, but over the years, the love for Tim Burton has definitely got into his head. He has become a little full of himself and I believe this film was his last truly great film. I always believe that a director should follow their vision, but when it may become a little much for some audience members to handle and you plan on making it a wide release, maybe a few considerations should be taken into account.Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are terrifically cast as the voices of these characters, matching their mannerisms in almost every conceivable way. The characters are really what sell this film for me. Even though they are clay figures places into a stop-motion film, I believed this story was possible, in some sort of alternate reality. This is a very well-made film with an intriguing screenplay from start to finish, filled with inventive sequences and a perfect conclusion to this simple, yet clever little story. Corpse Bride may not be one of my favourite films by Tim Burton, but it is certainly a great one. Highly recommended for Burton fans who have yet to see it.","40","Action & Adventure, Animation, Kids & Family, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Comedy","johnny depp|helena bonham carter|emily watson|tracey ullman|paul whitehouse|joanna lumley"

"corpse_bride","Coming in at a mere 77 minutes, Corpse Bride is a short-little-fun adventure, even though there could have clearly been some more room for character development.One of the things I love most about Tim Burton's films is the promise of an epic adventure. Corpse Bride is a far more contained story than his previous effort, Big Fish, but it does have some adventurous moments. In fact, it's kind of like a cross between Edward Scissorhands and Beetlejuice. But to me, there was just something missing.The voice talent is strong here with frequent Burton collaborators Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter tackling the groom and the 'corpse bride' respectively. But I didn't find either character to be all that compelling. Victor Van Dort (Depp) is a shy groom with a lack of confidence, and he doesn't have the charisma to get me to root hard for him. On the other-hand, the corpse bride has an intriguingly tragic backstory, but also falls victim to bland dialogue. To me, the most interesting characters are the ones in the background who come and go with eccentric scenery.A film is only as good as its leads, and although it's impressively animated by Laika, the characters end up taking second fiddle to a gothic underbelly of strange characters feasting on the inexperience of the bride and the groom. I like the attempt of Burton and crew, and there certainly is some joy to be had here, but the execution just isn't there. Style over substance. To put it bluntly, the film itself is more dead than it is alive.+Eccentric side characters-Imaginative but lacks thought out characters-Incomplete execution5.3/10","25","Action & Adventure, Animation, Kids & Family, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Comedy","johnny depp|helena bonham carter|emily watson|tracey ullman|paul whitehouse|joanna lumley"

"corpse_bride","'Tim Burton's Corpse Bride' delves deep into the social constraints of the 19th century, and is overly concerned with death, yet still has the ability to connect with children - this is a family movie in a class of its own!That said, I would not recommend this to very young children, as some scenes may prove frightening; nonetheless 'Tim Burton's Corpse Bride' gives a positive outlook on the afterlife, presenting it as a much more upbeat and optimistic version of 'the land of the living'. As well as this, some of the key moments of the plot are sung, and others are easily missed, so this film requires a little concentration in order to understand the story.Nonetheless, those over the age of nine should find this an enjoyable story, but this is far from just a children's movie; 'Tim Burton's Corpse Bride' should entertain both children and adults. The story is somewhat touching, and highly original; this is not only a visual treat but a heartfelt and whimsical piece of art. This is like nothing you've never seen before!

The design of this world is nice, creepy, and fun, which is to be expected from Tim Burton. The music, which is a highlight of the film, is also very lively, quirky, and spooky, which is also to be expected from Tim Burton's 'music buddy', Danny Elfman.The story is interesting, but nothing really all that special. The villain is pretty weak, and even the main characters aren't that interesting. None of the characters are, really, but that isn't enough to make this a bad movie.However, I can't say this is a great one. It's good. It's fun. The animation and music is really quite good.

"pirates_of_the_caribbean_the_curse_of_the_black_pearl","The humor is good but not prevalent, the visuals and action are terrific and the entertainment factor is strong in The Curse of the Black Pearl which succeeds as a very strong, though overlong start of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise even if it is low-key in approach and thus less fun but also less silly than the other entries. And this is the movie that gave us that legendary score and introduced us to Jack Sparrow for the first time and Johnny Depp should be commended for creating such an iconic character.","40","Action & Adventure, Science Fiction & Fantasy","johnny depp|geoffrey rush|orlando bloom|keira knightley|jack davenport|kevin mcnally"
"pirates_of_the_caribbean_the_curse_of_the_black_pearl","An Awesome performance by Johnny Depp as the now iconic Captain Jack Sparrow.

"pirates_of_the_caribbean_the_curse_of_the_black_pearl","Well who'd of thought a film about a theme park ride would become so huge. A simple theme park attraction that I rode when I was but a wee nipper in Disney World Florida, and it wasn't that amazing if I recall. So Verbinski and Bruckheimer take many ideas and leafs out of the video game The Secret of Monkey Island and low and behold we have our pirate flick.Tis the year of our lord errr...the late 17th Century, or possibly the early 18th Century, not too sure, but plundering be a plenty! The crew of the Black Pearl are after cursed treasure and the blood of the last remaining pirate so they can break the curse put upon them for stealing the cursed gold in the first place. Unfortunately the last pirate is dead (cos they killed him) so they need his offspring instead, in the mean time Captain Jack Sparrow is wanting his beloved vessel back under his control.The plot is actually kinda fiddly methinks and even now I'm having to wrap my head around exactly why and how things happen. So the Aztec gold is cursed and that curse turns the pirates into the undead, skeletal warriors that are unable to be killed. Now is that really a curse? These guys are pirates, they live a life of danger and plundering, surely being immortal and invincible would be really handy traits to have no? I don't really understand why these guys wanna break the curse so badly and make themselves vulnerable to death which inevitably awaits them at every turn. Especially with the whole British Navy after them all the time.There are many little quibbles I have with the plot really, in all the battle sequences the good guys fight the pirates, but what for?? they can't win, the pirates can't be killed, it just seems so pointless to me. To break the curse all the pirates that stole the gold need to put their blood back into the chest along with all the gold...I think, yet that isn't made clear. You tend to think its just the offspring of Bootstrap Bill, this is why Sparrow wipes his blood on the coin in the end which I never clicked on. That leads me to the other point or mistake that Barbossa is shot by Sparrow before Turner drops the last blood soaked coin into the chest. So doesn't that mean that at the exact moment he was shot he was still cursed and invincible? Thusly he should have survived that bullet. The coin should of been in the chest before Barbossa was shot surely.Quibbles aside the film is actually a rollicking good adventure the likes of which hadn't been seen for some time. In the good old fashioned tradition of Errol Flynn swashbucklers by jove. I can't deny that the film is tremendous fun enhanced of course by the campy performance of Depp which came straight out of left field. No one really expected what Depp came up with and it was really fresh! The film could so easily have become a stuffy straight laced predictable action romp ('Cutthroat Island' anyone?) but the inclusion of Depp's Sparrow really gave a different angle. You have the obligatory hero in Bloom and of course the damsel in distress with Knightly but Sparrow was such a unique character giving such a quirky boost to the traditional proceedings. On top of that was the inclusion of a vast array of really decent pirate characters both good and bad from all sorts of ethnic backgrounds. This not only gave the film a nice comic book-esque feel but also actual realism as of course pirates of the day were a scurvy bunch from all over, pirates were pretty politically correct and hired anyone. I personally liked Mr Cotton and his parrot in the traditional sense there. Ragetti and Pintel are a classic slapstick duo of baddie pirates that amuse nicely. Whilst Kevin McNally as Gibbs gives us another traditional approach with lots of golden pirate dialog that I think stems from Robert Newton and Disney's 1966 Treasure Island film.Gotta give kudos to the makeup and costume designs for the pirates, they really do look completely unwashed. Their teeth, facial hair, coarse knotted looking head hair, even their eyes, it all looks really authentic. Naturally Sparrow isn't quite as scruffy as the rest but his attire is definitely more effeminate which is funny, more so with his body language. Oh and Barbossa...Soul Calibur the movie much? Cervantes if you ask me, just running that up the flagpole to see if anyone salutes it.In all honesty there are so many good characters in this film its hard to narrow them all down. Then you have the typical type of visuals that you'd think Tim Burton had a hand in, excellent dark atmospheric sequences and shots including dark misty seascapes, fog bound galleons, the yellow glow of light from a cross hatched window pane breaking through the gloomy night, skeleton pirates in the moonlight, bleak islands by night etc...Then on the flip side there are the gorgeous daylight visuals of the British ports, sandy beaches, palm trees, galleons and various other vessels harbouring against tropical settings etc...its all here. Everything you'd expect to see and everything you want to see in a good old fashioned pirate film. I can see why the film expected to bomb as its one of those dodgy types of genres, but from the offset you can see the quality of detail on display. Everything really looks top dollar all the way through the film but amazingly the film has such a good range of characters (which is unusual lets be honest) it really doesn't matter. For once a Hollywood blockbuster actually got it right and gave us something other than flashy special effects, they gave us good fun characters we care about...to a degree. Also the special effects aren't all CGI which is one for the books (skeletons aside), a lot of the action is using real sets, real explosions, real stunts and in real locations which really does make all the difference, just like in the good old days.The actual pirate skeletons still look OK but of course feel a bit dated these days. The CGI can't be hidden with these guys and it is obvious, that inescapable fake plastic feel about them. Should have used stop motion I reckon hehe.To this day I still can't believe this summer blockbuster managed to do what the creators set out to do. To make a film harking back to the days of the silver screen, the golden age of Hollywood and at the same time use traditional real time effects without much use of CGI (what they did use was sensibly done, sparingly). They took an Errol Flynn swashbuckler added some nice touches of humour, a little modern action here and there, a dash of good old fashioned sea tales/myths and cranked up the location visuals to produce a top adventure. If only the plot had been a little clearer in places. Gotta love the film title though huh.","35","Action & Adventure, Science Fiction & Fantasy","johnny depp|geoffrey rush|orlando bloom|keira knightley|jack davenport|kevin mcnally"

"pirates_of_the_caribbean_the_curse_of_the_black_pearl","The film that started it all. At the time of it's release I had 2 friends who saw this and walked out which i never understood. To me this film has everything needed for an instant classic. A good blend of comedy, action and Disney magic. The world feels real and lived in and each scene feels like you could walk into the background and have an adventure of your own. Where later films (4 & 5) suffer is in this lack of scale and scope. Understandably this lead to a huge success especially with Depp's fantastic performance as Jack Sparrow (before it became stale) Here the Character feels like it has depth and is much more than the stumbling buffoon of latter films.","45","Action & Adventure, Science Fiction & Fantasy","johnny depp|geoffrey rush|orlando bloom|keira knightley|jack davenport|kevin mcnally"

The movie is a little bit dated so the beheadings and blood was not as realistic, which made it really easy for me to start watching this film. It wasn't too over-the-top.Honestly my heart was racing, it was a good thriller, you were trying to figure out who was guilty, and boy can I not wait to see this movie again! Highly recommended and I'm going to give more scary movies a chance.","45","Horror, Romance, Mystery & Suspense","johnny depp|christina ricci|miranda richardson|casper van dien|michael gambon|christopher walken"

"sleepy_hollow","Sleepy Hollow manages to impressively balance out a brutally graphic premise with an interesting mystery and decidedly timely humor. It's easily one of Tim Burton's most entertaining adventures to date.Period pieces are ripe for great horror flicks. To me, the creepiest film of 2016 has been The Witch, and that's large part due to the eerie 17th century setting on a secluded farm. Sleepy Hollow is a much more habited town, but the same eerie tone is set brilliantly by cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki. I love the way he and Burton used the town itself as a character which is a part of the mystery. Speaking of the mystery, It's nice to see Burton tackle a mystery, which I believe is the only time he's ever ventured into that genre. And he handles it well for the most part. A good portion of the film focuses on why exactly a headless horseman is taking out certain members of the Sleepy Hollow community, with Johnny Depp's Ichabod Crane at the center of the investigation. Crane, in typical Burton fashion, is a bit of an eccentric and unpredictable twist to his detective style. But the real issue with some of the mystery is that the third act reveals come at a rapid pace and the story gets a little convoluted.With that said, once we get caught up as an audience, Burton gives us a juicy climatic showdown with the infamous horseman, and it doesn't disappoint. He's done a few horror films, but Sleepy Hollow ranks up there with some of his best overall features. It has his distinguished tone and style with plenty of colorful kills by one of the great horror villains of all time, the headless horseman. An awkward romance and a somewhat convoluted third act prevent it from being flawless, but it's more than just your average horror entertainment.+Lubezki+Burton hits all the right beats+Amazing climax+Well-crafted-Iffy romance-Somewhat confusing reveals9.0/10","45","Horror, Romance, Mystery & Suspense","johnny depp|christina ricci|miranda richardson|casper van dien|michael gambon|christopher walken"

"sleepy_hollow","Tim Burton would seem like the perfect person to direct an adaption of Washington Irving's 'the Legend of Sleepy Hollow'. He gets much of the visuals right, but Mr. Burton has often times delivered on the look of his films. He tends to blow it on the story. Her he massacres the classic tale, completely changing the plot and stripping away the meanings behind the original tale. Shame on him!

"sleepy_hollow","Excellent atmospheric thriller is both fun and funny while being fairly frightening in some spots. Mostly it's about the set decoration which consists of the entire town of Sleepy Hollow, built from the ground up to meet Director Tim Burton's vision of what Sleepy Hollow should look like. The acting is fine, if a bit silly at times, but this is actually a lighter mystery than conventional horror or gothic ghost story. Depp is fun as Crane, although Ricci is a bit miscast as the object of his affection. And honestly, Burton could have made better use of Christopher Walken, who is reduced to a fairly inconsequential role. We rarely see him, except in very brief glimpses of head-chopping and off he goes on his dark pony. I enjoy this movie a great deal, if mostly for the near-perfect set decoration, atmosphere and mood. Lots of nice images of spooky jack-o-laterns, misty fields and wet marshlands. It's alot of fun but seems to go on a bit too long and overstay its welcome. 15-20 minutes leaner might have been a wise move. But, overall it's a lesser effort from Burton but still one of his best and most enjoyable if you don't pick apart some liberties he took with the story. Nice annual tradition to watch around Halloween.","40","Horror, Romance, Mystery & Suspense","johnny depp|christina ricci|miranda richardson|casper van dien|michael gambon|christopher walken"
"sleepy_hollow","Sleepy Hollow is a solid, but disappointing movie. It has such a strong visual flair with a great imagery and good atmosphere, the tone is fine and its story is pretty good with some interesting details, but its acting is quite bland, the characters are mostly boring and should have been much better realized and it doesn't really work as a horror film because it makes the fatal mistake of showing the Horseman for way too long, thus effectively removing the suspense.","35","Horror, Romance, Mystery & Suspense","johnny depp|christina ricci|miranda richardson|casper van dien|michael gambon|christopher walken"

"sleepy_hollow","This is perhaps one of Tim Burton's more visually impressive films, but, like every film he puts out, it lacks an impressive story to work alongside it. Based on the famous Washington Irving short story, Sleepy Hollow has all the facets of a compelling horror mystery story, but the storytelling itself is muddled and fails to be truly engaging in the way that it could, and should, be. The acting here is pretty good, however. This is one of Johnny Depp's better, and more subdued, collaborations with Burton, and he makes for a charming lead amidst the bland narrative. Christina Ricci is also engaging, and works as a strong supporting character to Depp's Ichabod Crane. The rest of the cast is serviceable too. The $100 million price tag of this film is very evident, with beautiful production design and costumes that add to the late 18th century setting. The film is also beautifully shot by the always reliable Emmanuel Lubezki; Lubezki's haunting imagery definitely adds an extra layer of creepiness to the town of Sleepy Hollow. These production values allow Sleepy Hollow to be creepy and frightening at times, but the script just isn't consistent enough to make it a truly worthwhile horror mystery film, which is ultimately rather disappointing.","30","Horror, Romance, Mystery & Suspense","johnny depp|christina ricci|miranda richardson|casper van dien|michael gambon|christopher walken"

"sleepy_hollow","Good stuff! Tim Burton does it again, a rehashing of a classic horror mystery right at the end of the decade. Danny Elfman nails the haunting score that we have come to know and love in Tim Burton films. Johnny Depp jumps into the seat of the detective Ichabob Crane and unlike the cowardly one from the Disney film, this one is locked and loaded and feels fairly confident but a troll. A bit awkward, a bit crazy, our hero has a dark backstory. The plot is pretty good.

"sleepy_hollow","Another Johnny Depp-Tim Burton combine, with Depp not being 'full blown'. The visuals are typical Burton gothic - and there is, like in most of his other movies, never any sunlight - it's always winter and twilight or night. With the creepiness set by lighting, it gets a booster with Depp's act - but its only creepiness, not horror, and I don't think it was meant to be a horror/slasher movie either. It's a crime and detection with the supernatural thrown in. And that works well.Ok Watch.","40","Horror, Romance, Mystery & Suspense","johnny depp|christina ricci|miranda richardson|casper van dien|michael gambon|christopher walken"
"sleepy_hollow","While, the movie is visually pleasing and chilling, it takes certain leaps to fulfill it's narrative that leave you scratching your head. If you believe Depp is a competent investigator you won't have an issue, but he plays early like he's a scared bumbling fool. Depp carries the film despite some spotty dialogue and the supporting cast does just enough to make this solid. If Burton had tightened it up a bit it could have been truly amazing.","35","Horror, Romance, Mystery & Suspense","johnny depp|christina ricci|miranda richardson|casper van dien|michael gambon|christopher walken"

"breakfast_with_hunter","They say that documentaries live or die based on their subject, and that is especially the case when it comes to cinema verite. While the director does exercise certain control over the film's look or feel and the editing process, he has little control over the actual content in the film. For the most part, the director has to pick an interesting enough subject and hope that something entertaining will happen to them. Wayne Ewing picked a terrific subject in Hunter S. Thompson, but showed that a great subject does not guarantee a great film.   In case you've been asleep for the past thirty-five years or so, Hunter S. Thompson is the famed author of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail, and most recently Kingdom of Fear. He has written for numerous publications, including Rolling Stone and ESPN. Through Thompson's writing, he has established himself as the ageless hipster, the spokesperson for America's counterculture, the rebel outlaw trying to shake up the system, and practically the poster boy for recreational drug use in America. He's cooler than cool and has the books, the feature film and now the documentary to prove it. There are few individuals in America, or maybe even on the planet, who are nearly as colorful, energetic, and of course controversial than Hunter.  Breakfast with Hunter takes place during 1996 and 1997, and focuses partly on the two most significant events in Hunter's life at the time, an impending DUI trial in Aspen and the upcoming film project for his classic book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Most of the scenes, however, are five minute random slices of his life, ranging from him cooking breakfast on the farm, to his trying to teach Johnny Depp's bird how to talk.   We are supposed to get bite-sized tastes of Hunter's life, but most of the scenes seem to celebrate his celebrity rather than provide any insight into his life or personality. There are too many scenes where time is spent making speeches in his honor, reading passages from his book, or just namedropping celebrities or famous figures that he encounters. Instead of a penetrating picture of his life, we are left with an adulatory look at his character. In most scenes, he seems all too aware that the cameras are there, and he subsequently postures for them, which gives the film a superficial feel. Not surprisingly, the most engaging scenes of the film are when he reveals a side that someone might not otherwise see, such as the scene where he argues with Alex Cox, the first director assigned to his film project. Instead of continuing in this direction, they revert to making Hunter look cool, this time by watching a video of the same scene, laughing at how harsh he was.  Hunter himself is what makes this film worth watching, just because he is such a fascinating human being. His inarticulate and playful manner gives the movie some charm, which partly makes up for its lack of substance. He makes us laugh when he goes crazy with a fire extinguisher in Rolling Stone headquarters, or shows off his talent for throwing whiskey. He is a genuinely likeable guy and a pleasure to watch, most of the time.  Breakfast for Hunter is currently making its rounds on the festival circuit, and there may be a theatrical release in its future. If you can't wait, however, the DVD is already available from the website, and its loaded with special features.

"breakfast_with_hunter","Disjointed, unfocused look at Hunter S Thompson's later life, around the time he was facing a DUI trial in Aspen and when his book, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, was being made into a movie. Highlights include him spraying Jenn Wenner with a fire extinguisher during a visit to the Rolling Stone offices in New York. He also erupts at Alex Cox during the director's visit to his 'fortified compound', Owl Farm, when Cox was in talks to make Fear and Loathing (there was a lawsuit, details of which are covered in extras on the Criterion DVD of Fear and Loathing). Thompson is most upset by Cox's plan to animate Steadman's drawings, thinking he's being trivilised. Ironically, a new director is brought in -- Terry Gilliam, a former animator. But by then, the producer knew how to handle Hunter, and probably making him a cartoon was never again mentioned. To ensure Johnny Depp's place in the film, Hunter agrees to teach Johnny's mynah how to talk, a surreal scene, when the bird gets loose in Hunter's house. Hunter also meets Eugene McCarthy and George McGovern at a 75th birthday bash for McGovern. And, he attends the Fear and Loathing premiere with George Plimpton in tow. Sad, both these writers are now gone.","30","Documentary, Television, Special Interest","johnny depp|benicio del toro|p.j. o'rourke|john cusack|terry gilliam|alex cox"

"breakfast_with_hunter","Directed by Wayne EwingThis is the first of two documentaries I watched about Hunter S. Thompson, and it turns out I had already seen both previously. No matter, as the antics of Hunter S. Thompson are timelessly entertaining. This film covered the years of roughly 1997-2002, and one of the main focuses is on the production of the film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.To watch this film in contrast to earlier documentaries such as Hunter Goes to Hollywood and Fear and Loathing in Gonzovision is interesting since he is such a character. During the time frame of this documentary, Hunter was at least 60, and you would expect even a wild character such as him to be slowing down, but not Hunter, as his fans should know better than that. He is as outrageous and as outspoken as ever, the film even chronicles his DUI arrest from 1995 on election day, which Hunter fought furiously as he felt he was at the center of a political witch hunt, as evidenced by the fact that he blew a Breathalyzer test well below the Colorado state limit and was convinced the arresting officers acted without merit which he was later able to prove. Of course, the judge ruled that the officer's lies did not matter and he would have to proceed with a trial anyway.Alongside this story the production of the film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is chronicled, which is interesting in and of itself, because as anyone that has watched the Criterion DVD knows, the film became a mess itself. The original writing team of husband Alex Cox (who was set to direct) and wife Tod Davies, were later fired from the film due to 'creative differences' with Hunter, who constantly stood up for the film because he believed it to be his best work.This incident itself is documented in the film when Alex Cox and Tod Davies show up to discuss their script (which of course Hunter didn't read) and other ideas for the film. A polite disagreement ends in Hunter shouting at them and calling the producer Laila Nabulsi to shout at her as well.When it becomes obvious that Alex Cox and Tod Davies are not the right artists to adapt the book into a film, it is left up to Hunter to ask his good friend Johnny Depp to wait another month without work while a new director is found for the movie. Due to their kinship (which is also explored throughout the film), Johnny agrees to wait, for which we are all glad, because as we now know, Fear and Loathing turned out to be one of Johnny's defining roles.Peppered throughout these escapades are interviews with some of Hunter's best friends, from the actors John Cusack, Sean Penn, Johnny Depp, and Benicio Del Toro, to the forever Thompson-linked artist Ralph Steadman, and even Hunter's son Juan. Through these interviews we learn how Hunter has impacted and influenced most of the current generation of entertainers. He broke the mold of expectations of the role model and celebrity, both of which he was most certainly not, at least in his own mind.However, the film also recognizes his strong moral values and how vehemently he implemented them in his own life and to the others around him. This is the portrait of a strong and outspoken man, and how his wild and often erratic behavior so well served the statement his life made.9.1/10","45","Documentary, Television, Special Interest","johnny depp|benicio del toro|p.j. o'rourke|john cusack|terry gilliam|alex cox"

"breakfast_with_hunter","Rough, free-flowing document of a few years in the 1990s with gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson. While this straight-to-video film gives little insight into his writing, and is technically shoddy (bad sound, bad cinematography, songs are clumsily inserted without any reason, etc.) , it gives you a relaxed feeling of hanging out with Thompson during a series of revealing antics: an appearance with Johnny Depp and John Cusack at the Viper Room; spraying uptight Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner with a fire extinguisher; discussing his DUI case with the Aspen City police; illustrator Ralph Steadman confessing he always felt he should have had equal credit with Thompson for their shared works; and, in the most arresting scene, throwing filmmaker Alex Cox (then signed to direct Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas) out of his house for having too many animated sequences in the planned film. Often it is difficult to hear Thompson's low, guttural murmurs (there are optional subtitles) but this only adds to the gonzo feeling of the film, which well reflects the subject. There is something perversely satisfying in watching a bonafide genius constantly misbehaving, unafraid to look like a fool, smoking, smoking pot, and constantly drinking (including while driving, not with a bottle but an open glass of Scotch).Enjoyable if ultimately not quite satisfying in its portrait of a major literary figure.  The DVD extras are sometimes even more interesting than what is in the film. We see P.J. O'Roarke discussing Thomas Mann and Vladimir Nabokov with Thompson (one of the few literary discussions); writing a song (and it sounds pretty bad) with Warren Zevon; and discussing the fate of his Fear and Loathing co-pilot Oscar Acosta. Unfortunately, the commentary track with Thompson and filmmaker Wayne Ewing is tedious and not enlightening.","30","Documentary, Television, Special Interest","johnny depp|benicio del toro|p.j. o'rourke|john cusack|terry gilliam|alex cox"

"pirates_of_the_caribbean_dead_mans_chest","'Fifteen men on the Dead Man's Chest Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum! Drink and the devil had done for the rest Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!'Who'd of thought a movie based on a theme park and pirates would be so successful that it would garner a sequel. A sequel that was so so so utterly huge in production values it makes perfect sense that it would fail to live up to its predecessor. The old lesson Hollywood never learns, making things bigger and flashier doesn't always mean it will be better.The plot? oh geez where to begin. This is the main issue with this franchise which begun in this sequel, only to get worse in the third film. The story becomes so convoluted and twisty its hard to keep up, and this is a Disney film! Put very simply...most of the characters are all after various bit n pieces including Davy Jones heart, Sparrow's compass and the Black Pearl. Each character has their own reason for needing each item and most of these reasons intertwine with each other at some point, oh and old characters come back into the fray.The plot is the first film was pretty straight forward, I'm not saying simple is best but it was easy to swallow. This film kicks off relatively well with the characters we know in trouble for helping Sparrow, a deal is set, a plan underway and everybody knows who is doing what and why. The trouble is as the film progresses sub plots pop up, new characters enter with their own story arcs, old characters come back with more story arcs, plans change and double crossing ensues. I can't deny it becomes tricky but in the end it is decipherable and when you think about it its quite good.So once you've got your head around the plot you do tend to notice how big everything has become. The prison Sparrow escapes from at the start looks very similar to some kind of fortress you'd expect to see in a Tolkien story. The entire early cannibal infested island part of the film really does show how the franchise took a swing for the worst. Sparrow, Norrington and Turner break out into a three way fight over Jones chest which lasts for at least 10-15 minutes, displays way way too much slapstick, completely unbelievable cartoon stunts that detach you from the film and the trio end up covering half the island whilst battling! In short the whole sequence wasn't needed, it was completely overblown and merely flashy filler, it bared no importance to the plot whatsoever...and this is what you will come to expect from the franchise thereafter.Now of course we know this franchise is a comedy of sorts, a period set comedy action thriller for everyone to enjoy. The first film had a nice balance of that plus some supernatural fantasy that really worked well. This sequel added that horrendous cartoonish hijinx that totally tore you away from any suspension of disbelief because it went beyond that into a pure hokey farce.On top of the ludicrous tomfoolery now on show this film has easily had much more creative influence from the classic videogame The Secret of Monkey Island. If you know the game its quite plain to see really, the cannibal island at the start, the murky, misty, swampy location where the team meet voodoo priestess Tia Dalma and of course that character in her entirety, plus the similarity Jones has to LeChuck in terms of evil behaviour, the supernatural and looks.It is a shame because the film is a good fantasy with some gorgeous visuals both CGI and real time. Davy Jones and his crew are incredible, a real sight to behold, especially Jones squid-like face of course. Its amazing to actually see CGI that looks so good you think its a real makeup job. The other crew members are also so vividly imaginative and well crafted, every scene with these fishy dogs was really great fun, I was always looking out for different types of mutants in the background. I really liked their vessel the Dutchman and the war torn barnacle covered ghost ship appearance it was given (much like the Pearl and its ghostly shrouds of mist n fog), and of course the Kraken was a fun nautical myth to include if somewhat unoriginal and not too good on the CGI front.Its still a fun film which is saved by the British actors and their astoundingly fun well spoken pomposity, that and the excellent effects on Jones and his (undead?) crew. The finale for Sparrow is an exciting cliffhanger even though you know he will be back. Its interesting to see a group of heroes bickering and double crossing each other instead of simply fighting together as one unbeatable team, and that supernatural spice is just right. The plot difficulties do mire proceedings but Verbinski just about pulls it off and manages to provide decent escapism.","30","Action & Adventure, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Comedy","johnny depp|orlando bloom|keira knightley|jack davenport|bill nighy|geoffrey rush"
"pirates_of_the_caribbean_dead_mans_chest","A great follow up to the original film. For a lot of people this is the beginning of the franchise losing it's way but to me this still felt fresh and real (to a degree). All the actors embody their characters well and the blend of action and comedy is still perfect. Here the stakes feel important and that this is an important moment in these characters lives rather than 'adventure of the week' that some of the later films feel. To me this still feels like the characters are being true to themselves with twists and turns that make sense.","45","Action & Adventure, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Comedy","johnny depp|orlando bloom|keira knightley|jack davenport|bill nighy|geoffrey rush"
"pirates_of_the_caribbean_dead_mans_chest","I can't help but wonder what kinda franchise this might be if Verbinski stayed at the helm. Not that it would be great by any means...it's certainly still much too convoluted and dark, especially for a Disney film. However, he brought some interesting stuff to the whole affair. The action-adventure scenes here are largely big, giant fun (escaping from natives, sea battles), and the overall look for the world is great (sans the CG tentacles).

"pirates_of_the_caribbean_dead_mans_chest","This movie has strangely low reviews and yes there are some flaws, but not to many for this to be a awful movie.

Some characters kind of just pop out of no wear and jump into the conversation and act like they know the main characters. But the main problem with this movie is that it doesn't really explain stuff to you, so you want to watch the next one. It's fine to set up a movie, but make a good movie at the same time.

"pirates_of_the_caribbean_dead_mans_chest","The most common outlook on the Pirates series seems to be the belief that the first movie is the only good one, and that they deteriorate from there on. In my eyes, this couldn't be farther from the truth. Dead Man's Chest returns bigger, bolder and louder. Depp is at the top of his game; arguably even funnier than the first. Bill Nighy's Davy Jones is a menacing and worthy villain, partly in thanks to the unbelievably good special effects (effects that are even better than 2017's Dead Men Tell No Tales). The soundtrack, like the first, is booming and strong, punctuating the scary and elevating the intensity. Where Dead Man's Chest falters is the mildly over-bloated plot. So many things are happening at once, it's oftentimes hard to focus on them all. Another thing that may turn some off is the shift in tone about halfway through the movie, going from silly and over-the-top to more serious. I thought this was a great way of keeping things energized, considering the film clocks in at 140 minutes before credits. The central theme here is what it means to be a good person: and Captain Jack is put to the test. This leads to an emotionally resonating ending, something most blockbusters lack. Minor gripes aside, Dead Man's Chest is a worthy sequel, even over a decade later.","45","Action & Adventure, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Comedy","johnny depp|orlando bloom|keira knightley|jack davenport|bill nighy|geoffrey rush"

"pirates_of_the_caribbean_dead_mans_chest","A sequel to Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2002) this movie was released 4 years later and filmed back to back with its sequel At Worlds End (2007). While I found the plot of the first film very simple this time around the plot gets a lot more complicated (thus the need for two movies). While the action is amped up (especially any of the scenes with the Kraken) the film loses a bit of the comedy it had and has a much darker tone this time around. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) are arrested on their wedding day by the East India Trading Company for assisting Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) previously. Led by Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) who wants Will to find Jack Sparrow and retrieve his magic compass from him. Cutler wants to find the heart of Davy Jones (Bill Nighly), so that he has complete control of Jones and his crew aboard the Flying Dutchman therefore controlling the seas. Some positives on this one like I said is the action is well done (although some of the CG is a bit dated 11 years later). The character development is more believable this time. There's some actual plot twists that add to the story. It also features a very cool ending sort of like the Empire Strikes Back that makes you look forward to the next film. The film itself though has maybe too many subplots. There's a subplot involving a voodoo witch named Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris) that doesn't even remotely make sense until you watch the third film, then there's a subplot with Norrington (Jack Davenport) from the first film and his 'redemption.' Not to mention the entire reason why Beckett even wants Will's help is kinda dumb. Overall, still a solid watch and a pretty decent sequel (I wish I could say the same for the next few).","35","Action & Adventure, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Comedy","johnny depp|orlando bloom|keira knightley|jack davenport|bill nighy|geoffrey rush"

"pirates_of_the_caribbean_dead_mans_chest","Sometimes it's really hard to see past a film's flaws. For whatever reason though, I really get a kick out of these Pirates adventures. Whether it be because I had fond memories of them when I was much younger, or because there just wasn't quite a spectacle like them in the mid-2000's, either way I still find Dead Man's Chest to be an admirable part of the franchise.I'm not sure there will ever be a Pirates film as good as the first one. There's nothing quite like that first adventure with Jack Sparrow, William Turner, and Elizabeth Swann. And Dead Man's Chest wastes no time trying to top the spectacle and scope of that film. However, when the story and characters are second fiddle to the set pieces and grand action sequences, that's where you have the problem. In many ways, this film only exists to set up the third film. Most of the story beats are drawn out in what could be only one film's worth of story, but we don't get the payoff for any of it until the 3rd adventure. That's not necessarily always a bad thing, but I would have preferred each film to stand on its own a little bit more.Although we don't get Geoffrey Rush's maniacal Captain Barbossa, we are treated with equally invested performances from Bill Nighy as Davy Jones and Stellan Skarsgard as Boostrap Bill. Jones', the main antagonist, is essentially a supernatural pirate with the ability to also control a large sea creature called, the Kraken. If you thought the original film takes advantage of the over-the-top side to the series, the second one doubles down. Luckily, Nighy is an absolute joy to watch on screen, thanks in large part due to the groundbreaking special effects of Jones & various other characters and creatures.Much like the first film, Dead Man's Chest is a bit overlong and has too many moving parts. It worked with the first film because the script, directing, and performances were all brilliant. I think some of the magic wore off here because you definitely feel the length. But there's no denying the entertainment value if you enjoyed the first outing. The ridiculousness continues to an island of indigenous people wanting Jack Sparrow and subsequently a dog to be their ruler, a wheel barrow sword fight that goes on for like 15 minutes, and one great cliffhanger. I know they're silly, but I always manage to have a blast re-watching them.+Doubles down on ridiculous action+Mind-blowing special effects+Cliffhanger-Lengthy & too goofy at times7.6/10","35","Action & Adventure, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Comedy","johnny depp|orlando bloom|keira knightley|jack davenport|bill nighy|geoffrey rush"
"pirates_of_the_caribbean_dead_mans_chest","There was a time when Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest was my favorite Pirates of the Caribbean movie. That's probably because I used to watch the first one way too much and because this movie boasts my two favorite sequences in the entire franchise: the cannibal island escape and the final fight on Isla Cruces, in which Jack, Will, and Norrington have a somewhat rotational swordfight. The rest of the movie just doesn't stand up to the pure joy that is the first one, but that's not to say that I don't love this film. It is my second favorite Pirates of the Caribbean after all. The first film bests Dead Man's Chest in that it has a much less convoluted plot and it's overall more fun. And Dead Man's Chest falls into the usual sequel trap of turning everything up to 11 except the character's depth. It is still great to see the last movie's characters return though. Jack continues to be loveable, even if he's turned the crazy up to 11 as well. And Will and Elizabeth are still just as adorably in love, but there's something else about them that bothers me in this one. It seems like since the last one both of them have made the full transition to acting like pirates, even having the skills of pirates. Since when did Elizabeth learn how to swordfight? But it really isn't a big deal as they kinda need to know those skills especially as they go into the next movie. Dead Man's Chest also introduces us to some new characters, most notably the new villains: Lord Beckett and Davy Jones. They both provide some well needed foils for the other characters in the film, but they don't really get any depth until the next installment. There are a couple ways in which Chest is better than Black Pearl. Firstly, the action gets a lot cooler and more ridiculous. As I said, everything in this movie is amped up to 11, including the action. The special effects are also vastly improved over the last one. Davy Jones and his fish crew still look real and this movie came out in 2006. Another thing that I haven't heard anybody talk about is the music's improvement. While the first movie has a great score, it wasn't till Dead Man's Chest that Hans Zimmer came on as composer and he adds some fantastic and classic Pirates tracks, including Jack Sparrow's very own theme and others. Seriously, if you pay attention as you watch the first two movies, you'll notice the music change. In the end, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest provides more of the charm, thrills, and action that audiences loved from the first one. And you can't deny that the Kraken is bloody awesome...","50","Action & Adventure, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Comedy","johnny depp|orlando bloom|keira knightley|jack davenport|bill nighy|geoffrey rush"

"pirates_of_the_caribbean_dead_mans_chest","Not as funny as the first, but still a joy to watch. I enjoy the story and the over the top action scenes, which almost compensates for the loss of humor from the first movie.

I also feel like they took away from Elizabeths journey at Isla Cruces. But the twist in the end is nice. The soundtrack is still great and the movie still flows nice during the scenes. Though the movie feels a bit to long, with maybe one or two plot points to many.

"pirates_of_the_caribbean_dead_mans_chest","Aside from sequels in the biggest franchises of all time, like Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, it's very rare that a second instalment tops what the original film was able to accomplish. When Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl hit theatres, people around the world fell in love with these characters. While these films are no masterpieces, they are pure entertainment from start to finish. Upon its initial release, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest was actually my favourite of the franchise, but upon revisiting it through the years, that mantle has worked its way back to the original feature. This is a solid follow-up to a very fun first film, but its incredibly overlong and tiresome nature do take their toll. Many viewers choose to dislike every sequel this franchise has released, but I'm about to defend this one, because I think there is quite a bit of fun to be had here. Unlike the first, this film juggles too many plot elements, which may make audience members grow weary of the overall film. Playing as a sort of cat-and-mouse game as the heart of Davy Jones is the so-called 'mcguffin' here. Every character has their own agenda as to why they must acquire it and the tiring subplots really bog the film down at times. Quite honestly, this film could have used a bit of trimming down. There are so many exciting action sequences to enjoy throughout this film (quite memorable to be honest), but they are very spread out over the 150 minute run time. For this reason, this second instalment fails to shine all the way through. Whenever a film brings in a slew of new faces to enjoy, a film usually benefits from world building. With the few exceptions of certain films bringing in useless characters, the majority of the time will see beneficial additions. I found myself really intrigued by the character of Davy Jones, and the subplot of Will Turner coming across his father was easily the most heart given to this film. When you send characters on a fantastical adventure like this, there needs to be a sense of realism in the smaller moments, otherwise why should anyone care what happens to them in the end. This is a sequel that takes its time to develop the necessary characters in order to have a nice payoff in the end. The swash-buckling of the original film was fun and tasteful, but this instalment definitely cranks up the silliness of the action. From sword-fighting on top of a moving wheel, to pole-vaulting over a cliff while tied up, to attacking a giant squid monster, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is never afraid to go all out with its fantasy elements. For its time, the effects were actually quite good, but the budgets for these films are incredibly high, so that makes sense. If you haven't yet checked this film out, I will be recommending it, but just know that it becomes extremely silly and the stakes are thrown out the window quite often. As a sequel that's over 10 years old, it holds up quite well in my opinion. Looking back, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest was definitely meant for its time. Sure, the adventure aspects of all these films will live on forever, because everyone loves a good adventure. The jokes throughout these films will date eventually, but that happens with every film. Aside from bringing in new characters, some cool new set pieces, and a promise of much more to come, there isn't much new to like here. If you loved the first first film for what it was, you'll have some fun with this one too. I personally think this film receives a little too much hate and was a worthy sequel upon release. Fairly slow at times, but that's always made up with awesome action and adventure. If you haven't checked out this franchise or just haven't gone past the original, I believe this one is still worth a watch. Still to this day, I quite enjoy this sequel.","35","Action & Adventure, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Comedy","johnny depp|orlando bloom|keira knightley|jack davenport|bill nighy|geoffrey rush"

"1221547_alice_in_wonderland?","Tim Burton's take on the classic Lewis Carroll tale is more of a sequel to the animated movie from the 1951 set before Alice Through the Looking Glass than a movie that's faithful to the source material. I also admit that although this film is the ultimate guilty pleasure of just about everyone except the YouTube assholes, it's still not Burton's best film to date. There is an unnecessary reliance on CGI although it's somehow less distracting than all the CGI in Attack of the Clones and it also feels like Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings had a baby whom they gave up for adoption and was raised by Burton and the lady who wrote the screenplay. Because naturally, everyone blames the director and/or the actors if they hate the movie. No one ever looks at the screenwriter twice. However, the film more than makes up in certain flaws present with its amazing visuals, Johnny Depp's show-stealing performance as the Mad Hatter, a few humorous moments and how it manages to bring back some of the trippy zaniness from the animated movie whilst still remaining, in a way, fun for those who either didn't see the cartoon or hated it. So while this Alice in Wonderland movie may not cater to all tastes (especially for the more squeamish family members despite what the company name and MPAA rating might suggest), it still boasts enough of the vivid imagination of Tim Burton to be one of those types of movies that people hate but secretly love.","40","Action & Adventure, Kids & Family, Science Fiction & Fantasy","johnny depp|mia wasikowska|helena bonham carter|anne hathaway|matt lucas|jemma powell"

Yet again, Burton does just that and mixes in a bleak, tiresome world void of any happiness. While I can fully understand Burton's reasoning for not staying close to the book, it certainly doesn't work in his favor here. The final duel is clich�d, boring, and just not that good. It's entertaining for audiences that are younger but it just can't live up to a bar set by the original. lice in Wonderland is-yet again-another misguided attempt at a remake that succeeds on some levels, but fails horribly on others.","25","Action & Adventure, Kids & Family, Science Fiction & Fantasy","johnny depp|mia wasikowska|helena bonham carter|anne hathaway|matt lucas|jemma powell"

"1221547_alice_in_wonderland?","Alice in Wonderland review Alice in wonderland, the new Tim Burton's version of a magical book 'Alice's adventures in Wonderland'(Lewis Carroll), shows how a young lady called Alice interpreted by the talented Mia Wasikowska gets lost in a world completely different from what she knows. Creepy gardens and irregular characters like the Hatter (Johnny Depp) or the queen of hearts (Helena Bonham) will show her that the land of dreams is as real as she wants it to be. A fantastic under fantasy movie that is worth to watch.In the film, our principal character Alice lives a boring life that is controlled by her mother. On a very special day she decides to escape annoyed from the only decision she has right to make. At the beautiful dark gardens where she hides, she finds a little new friend that leads her to a totally unknown world. Now lost, she will have to face her destiny. The hatter, the bony with the clock, the twins and the smiling cat are going to be with her all along her fights and adventures.When talking about dressing, the creepy and funny style match perfectly with the story. Alice dresses represent every emotional state she passes through. The first one for example, exposes the lostness that she finds herself in; it is new, grey, scary, thin, and came from nowhere( just like her dream and fantasies). During the movie, she will develop her inner strength and skills which are going to be perfectly reflected in her presentation.The characters in this film present a challenge to the actors, because of its unusual madness roles. Hysterical and funny behaviors from the hatter for example, could not have been performed by anyone else but the talented johnny depp. This actor has shown to have incredible skills to act the most freakness scenes. The best example is the first one of course, when he sees Alice arriving to the tea party and starts walking on the table with a total control of disorder. The Hatter is clearly moved for his aleatory mad emotions and has not hesitate of acting above them. Johnny depp made an amazing job with this role. Other characters like the rabbit or the cat had to be made by computer with special effects, which the most remarkable is the smiling cat. Its foggy disappearance and appearance are smooth, colorful and well produced. Alice in wonderland is an amazing story for kids and adults. If the audience really pay attention to what is happening, they might learn something helpful to theirs lives. Although I don't like the idea that the new version of the story has cut some scenes from the original cartoon, I understand that it was necessary to make it more digestible. Wonderland can be compared with the actual world. Many viewers felt identified with the feeling of being in a place where everything is unnatural and crazy. The audience could find many positive thoughts that encourage to face the deepest fears( like dreaming), and walk forward their lifes. I strongly recommended only if the viewers are willed to get hooked to it. This is not a movie only for entertainment.","35","Action & Adventure, Kids & Family, Science Fiction & Fantasy","johnny depp|mia wasikowska|helena bonham carter|anne hathaway|matt lucas|jemma powell"

"1221547_alice_in_wonderland?","It will surprise most people that this movie is one of the top grossing films ever made as it sits alongside blockbusters like Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Pirates of the Caribbean & Toy Story on the box office score-board (#24 last time I checked {#44 with inflation}). However, unlike them, it's one of the most forgotten & un-talked about 'mega-hits' of the modern entertainment age. It even won 2 Oscars for Best Art Direction & Best Costume Design. Many people say it's a fluke & they could well be right as it's a good movie by all means but noway does it reach the classic timeless status of all those films that rightfully earned all that green. As Tim Burton's highest-grossing movie it's everything you'd expect from him; quirky, twisted, funny with moments of bedazzlement (if you're into a smothering of CGI) but it's heart & soul never fully reach the same level as the visual wonderment on screen. Overall it's just missing that star-power-X-factor that most memorable classics have.

"1221547_alice_in_wonderland?","This film is an abomination of the original Lewis Carrol source material. I have just read 'Alice's Adventures In Wonderland' to my 8 year old and can tell you this film resembles very little of it. I won't even go into a comparison or list of discrepancies because it would take too long. It would be easier to draw up a very short list of 'similarities'.Johnny Depp does the best he can do in this horrendous attempt at cashing in on a classic title. The practice of naming a film on a classic work of literature and bastardizing it to the point of no recognition should be illegal, but what's to stop a Hollywood production house from writing a big fat cheque to the literary rights holders for its use.The film is stereotypically dark as one would expect from Tim Burton. It makes me wonder how Burton could not have grown as an artist after 4 decades of spewing out the same 'gothic' perspective on his craft.

"1221547_alice_in_wonderland?","Alice In Wonderland is splendidly a visual treat with awesome cinematic and directorial qualities, this adaptation is weak in almost every other single aspect. The script panders to the quirky, awkward teenager that can only appreciate style over substance, and the film lacks narrative heft, which would usually be acceptable for Burton, except that the film emphasizes such an epic story that makes no sense in a non-Alice In Wonderland kind of way.

Of course, I have to give credit to my favourite part of the movie, Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter. Unbelievable performance by Depp in this movie, without him I am almost certain I would've hated this movie. As for the overall feel of the movie, I liked the Tim Burton creepy sort of aspect it gave off, but I could tell for a Tim Burton movie it could have done a lot better. By the end, you didn't get the feel of a Disney movie, and as it stands, the original 1951 Alice In Wonderland beats out its 2010 remake.

It's also a very uncomfortable film, but that ended up adding to my enjoyment.It feels like everyone involved gave 1000%, and Depp, Del Toro and Gilliam quite obviously didn't even consider restraining themselves from being fully insane. It's clear that a lot of effort was put into making it as strange as it could be, and that alone makes it hard for me to believe anyone could score this negatively. It wasn't lazily made, and then weird because of how lazy it is. It was carefully crafted to be this weird.I'm gonna be thinking about this one for a long time.

"fear_and_loathing_in_las_vegas","This has to be one of the most confusing films I have ever tried to give a rating. Unlike a film such as Primer or Inception which were complex but easily able to be seen as brilliant films this was simple in premise but I still can't decide whether this is a work of genius or terrible as far as plot is concerned. This can be down to the lack of considerable plot present in the film and the constant twisting and turning in the direction which the film actually takes. However, I can see the complexity in making a film like this into one with a definite plot as Duke is an unreliable narrator with the film being a culmination of his writing and work. Therefore, with him being drugged up throughout the film I believe it to be a form of Gonzo journalism which Hunter S Thompson was known for writing and so see the film as semi-autobiographical. Although the plot is one which I, through multiple viewings, still don't fully understand and so naturally would put the film in the middle regarding ratings, from the art style and humour of the film being constantly dark and busy with an interesting effect happening in every single scene I have to regard this film as more positive than negative. In my opinion this is a film any film lover should watch as it is interesting and not a pointless film as well as being different from any other film I have ever seen and in that sense is completely unique. Therefore, to conclude, with the acting being brilliant as well as the style of the film being definitively interesting I think anyone should watch this. I personally have to keep watching it for some reason even unknown to me.","40","Drama, Comedy, Special Interest","johnny depp|benicio del toro|gary busey|ellen barkin|christina ricci|cameron diaz"

"fear_and_loathing_in_las_vegas","While Terry Gilliam's visuals are as stupendous and enthralling as usual and Depp's performance is manicly hilarious, the film suffers from the same issue that plagued Thompson's book. The film is funny sporadically and actually insightful sometimes, but most of the time it's just too repetitive and pointless.

"fear_and_loathing_in_las_vegas","For as old as it is, the visuals are surprisingly stunning, Johnny Depp and Benico Del Toro are both odd and funny in this acid trip of a movie. Cameos by Toby Maguire and Gary Busey are downright hilarious, but the plot is a incoherent mess. I suppose that's appropriate, considering the state the two leads are in for most of the film though. Hard to follow but undeniably funny and odd in a good way, Fear and Loathing is a good time watching.","40","Drama, Comedy, Special Interest","johnny depp|benicio del toro|gary busey|ellen barkin|christina ricci|cameron diaz"
"fear_and_loathing_in_las_vegas","Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas centers around the life of controversial journalist Raoul Duke based on Hunter S. Thompson and his lawyer Dr. Gonzo. The plot tells the tale of Duke as he balances journalism with a problematic drug benge through California on his way to an anti-drug conference in Las Vegas. The film's main conflict surrounds our main character's inabilities to stay off highly potent drugs such as LSD and mescaline just to name a few. Covering news seems to be an afterthought throughout as the film focuses on their outlandish interactions with the people of Las Vegas, strangers and freaks alike. The allusion to the 70s is widely seen through the use of psychedelic drugs that have them imagining some of the most ridiculous and deplorable things. However, it is hard to care much about their characters because there is little to no character development in favor of trippy escapades. The film could be explored under the archetype of the journey as the main characters are on a mission to interact with sin city and often get lost and distracted from their main quest to report news but eventually find themselves in intriguing ways. However, there does not seem to be much rhyme or reason for the activities in the film, Duke and Gonzo are ranging addicts who are incessantly counting down the minutes until they can inject their next fix of highly potent drugs. As I watched the film I found it hard to care about how it would be resolved but rather when it would end as it took over-the-top filmmaking to a new level. The soundtrack and environment gave it a vintage 1970s vibe but Duke and Gonzo were nauseating to watch and were paper thin characters. It seems that the moral/social commentary of the film had something to do with the demonization of drug culture and a critique on the war on drugs as a highly problematic campaign. The central thread of the film was elementary at best and the editing and cinematography may have been the lone positives in a debauchery filled and aimlessly centered flick. While watching it I had to ask myself whether Depp was displaying good acting or was actually under the influence. I would be placed this film in the category of one of the worst films I have watched and I think it fails in telling an interesting story because of confusing pacing and an over-dramatization of the period and the individuals involved.","05","Drama, Comedy, Special Interest","johnny depp|benicio del toro|gary busey|ellen barkin|christina ricci|cameron diaz"
"fear_and_loathing_in_las_vegas","Just drug fueled fun and mayhem. Love this gonzo film and I feel that the lack of plot is actually part of the story. Its about two drugged out friends who are on a trip to cover a motorcycle race in the early 70's Vegas. Considering the state of the two main characters throughout the movie it doesn't really shock anyone that there is no purpose or goal in general. Basically to just continue the bender and survive without being placed in jail. The real genius of this flick is trying to follow the two's tale while seeing sights through their delusional minds mixed in with the actual state of things. Maybe my favorite of Depps flicks, other than the 9th gate.","45","Drama, Comedy, Special Interest","johnny depp|benicio del toro|gary busey|ellen barkin|christina ricci|cameron diaz"

"fear_and_loathing_in_las_vegas","I honestly don't know what to make of this, but given from this insane film leaving me with no feeling and wondering, 'What just happened?' I'll do my best to review it. Johnny Depp and Bencio Del Toro give out some fantastic performances, and their chemistry is really great. It's interesting how crazy and more crazy it can get, and the effects during the drug scenes look really good and they are definitely in a Gilliam style. The characters are repulsive, but enjoyable at the same time. There are some funny parts in it, but there were a lot of moments that I wasn't really sure if it was suppose to be funny. The plot is just there, like it's only about two crazy guys going to different places, doing crazy things. After finishing it, I was pretty much like, 'Ok, so that just happened.' I enjoy it I guess, and it was pretty much a trippy trip. When Terry Gilliam aid that he wanted Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas to be one of the best films, but also one of the worst ones, I can see that, and it turn out to be more of the middle, but towards the positive.","30","Drama, Comedy, Special Interest","johnny depp|benicio del toro|gary busey|ellen barkin|christina ricci|cameron diaz"
"fear_and_loathing_in_las_vegas","A thoroughly joyless experience. For the first hour of the film, it exudes such manic energy as to become monotonous.

"fear_and_loathing_in_las_vegas","Even Johnny Depp has some pure duds. Sure, Hunter S. Thompson is a strange interesting character in pop culture. Interesting enough to make a movie about ? Not really. For the person who dips and dabbles in psychedelic drugs maybe this movie can be somewhat interesting, IF you happen to be on said drugs at the time of watching this movie. For the average movie watcher though, this is nothing but an abnormal waste of time. Maybe its just me, but watching a feature length film about a bunch of people on a full blown acid trip the entire film is not just annoying, but downright stupid. And I don't even think a different group of actors or writers could have made this movie any better. I think a documentary about Hunter S. Thompson would be sufficient to tell his story. I understand the concept of the movie, pretty much taking you into the mind of someone who is completely strung out on drugs. But the entire movie? come on, it is a bit much if you ask me. Fear and Loathing in the end makes no sense at all. Watching other people trip out on acid is not fascinating at all, especially if you are not tripping out on acid yourself. Its like being a party where everyone is drinking and having a good time and you are sitting in the corner by yourself playing on your phone because you are the designated driver. Sure being the DD is admirable, and there should always be on available, but lets be totally honest, its zero fun. Which is the same with this movie.

"secret_window","'Secret Window' is well acted and there are some genuinely creepy moments but you can tell it's based on a short story because the movie feels padded out.Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp) is a stressed and depressed writer hiding in a secluded cabin to 'working' while avoiding his impending divorce. Mort is surprised when John Shooter (John Turturro), a Mississippi dairy farmer suddenly confronts him and accuses him of plagiarism. Mort dismisses the man until it becomes clear that Shooter's threats are genuine.Johnny Depp is convincing as an author who's circling the drain, wasting his time on the couch instead of writing, basically washed up and very bitter about his failed marriage. He makes for an interesting protagonist because just when you think it can't get any worse for him, it does. John Turturro is truly awesome as John Shooter, who comes out of the blue one day with some accusations of plagiarism. He comes off as really creepy when he asks not for money, but for a technical compensation. It's something to do with the story itself. I won't say any more. Turturro looks and sounds threatening in a creepy, offbeat way that gets you hooked.The problem is in the way the characters' reactions are written. Everyone is taking this news of death threats and impending violence like it's accusations of witchcraft. The town sheriff doesn't seem very concerned after things start to escalate, Mort's wife Amy (Maria Bello) doesn't even try to be cautious even when things are clearly spinning out of control. When threatened with death you still never sense that she realizes how dire the situation is. Mort even hires a bodyguard who treats the whole thing like it's a joke. All of these low-key responses take away a lot of the tension. It's too bad because it builds up tremendously whenever Mort and John are on-screen.There are some good parts here and there in 'Secret Window'. I liked the ending so overall it's an ok thriller. It's not great but worth taking a look to see if it will be your thing.

"secret_window","The film shows little respect to its audience. It serves up obvious twists and plot difficulties alongside dialogue so in-your-face that it leaves nothing to ponder about afterwards. John Turturro's performance was dull and monotonous, and unfortunately not redeemed by Maria Bello's above average acting. The score stood out to be the best part of the movie but again, unfortunately ruined by the swift cuts to cheap jumpscare imagery.

He turned the movie more funny and dark at the same time, he really did a good job. The movie could be considered a masterpiece in movies industry. It isn't only one more bloody movie. It has a clever story, a strong argument, organised screenplay, it's really unpredictable and we can really say that is plot is replet of Hitchcockian twists and turns, the final is really original and helps that the movie never stop improving at the end.

"secret_window","Was expecting a much better movie, but that's not what I got. Instead, I got a predictable thriller that feels as uninspired as another Transformers movie, but with much better acting. Johnny Depp is a great actor and easily the best thing in this movie (besides John Turturro, of course). The movie desperately wants you to know it's a plot twist movie from the very beginning. It puts clues everywhere and in the first 15 minutes, I figured out the ending. For the next 70 minutes, I just waited to see if I was right. And guess what, I was. The characters are interesting and Depp's descent into madness is more than entertaining, and even with such a predictable ending, it was cool to see Depp go batshit crazy! Throughout the movie Depp and Turturro keep saying that the ending is the most important part of a book. And Turturro's character wants Depp's character to fix the ending of his story. The only thing that REALLY needs fixing, is this movie's ending. All in all, a predictable thriller with an uninspired plot only worth seeing because of Depp's another great performance.","25","Mystery & Suspense, Drama","johnny depp|john turturro|maria bello|timothy hutton|charles s. dutton|len cariou"

"secret_window","Johnny Depp is a bit of a strange actor, i dont just mean in the sense that he takes on rather flamboyant or eccentric characters, but he also lacks consistancey in his movies. Sure pirates was awesome, fear and loathing was hilarious and edward scissor hands was a downright master performance. He has somewhat also had his fair share of lows, most of his latter catelogue with Tim Burton and Gore Verbinski, not to mention his box office failures like the tourist. However, when on his A game, he provides sterling performances again and again, always stealing the show and always committed. Here in Secret Window however his performance is rather blase, which when attached to much of the same towards the rest of the movie, makes for a rather boring, non frightening and forgettable show all round. The story follows Mort, a writer who appears to have had a troubling year. Flash forward 6 months and he is in the middle of a divorce, resided to a cabin in the middle of nowhere and having the worst case of writers block imaginable. One day he is visited by an ominous man called Shooter, claiming that Mort stole his work, baffled as Mort is, he soon finds himself locked in a dangerous game, where more than just Mort's life is a stake. Based on the Stephen King novel, by the same name, it plods along, with very little tension or purpose. The opening act is brutally sluggish and drags for an age, thats even with an acceptable performance by John Tutturo playing Shooter, his performance, in a pretty decent cast line up, is the best the movie has to offer. The rest of the film, continues to fall apart after that and before the end, were dissinterested and sick of what were seeing. Depp, is okay as the struggling writer, pulling off some form of a performance, its not his best though, it feels almost lazy. Tutturo does well but hardly has enough screen time to really make his encounters memorable. Maria Bello is pretty poor as Mort's ex wife and Charles Dutton seems likes hes just reading from the page most of the time. Your not gripped as an audience member. That being said, there are a few nice ideas littered throughout to spark off the occasional emotion. The finale, as stupid as it seems, actually has the skeleton of something rather frightening, it doesnt achieve the level it should but at least the thought was there. The camera work is extremely commendable, with some fluid and well planned out shots, weaving continunally not really allowing your eyes time to rest. The score by Philip Glass is pretty decent also, giving a specific feel which is extremely under utilized in this entire outing. The movie lacks any real scares, coming most from jump scare, which is downright lazy and unappealing. The pacing is horrid as well, the film feels half an hour longer than it is and with zero tension thats a massive problem. Having a great cast and a good looking movie wont make your film and thats what this film suffers from, its not given enough care and attention, the source material feels left at a distance, the characters even more so. Yes there is the occasional comedic moment or bizarre encounter but it ends up being all for nothing in this completely okay film. Thats alll i can really say, its not horrendous, but its as far away from a work of art as you can get with the talent involved. Missed opportunity.","25","Mystery & Suspense, Drama","johnny depp|john turturro|maria bello|timothy hutton|charles s. dutton|len cariou"

"pirates_of_the_caribbean_3","Well shiver my timbers...this here be damn complicated! The third and final part of the pirates trilogy (or so we thought). I've never until now have not understood the plot of a Disney film. Yep its long long long, overdrawn, CGI filled complicated mess with so many sub plots and double crosses I forgot what the film was about. This film is also, apparently, the most expensive film ever made ever! how fitting that its the worst in the trilogy. In short you have to know the back story for the last two films relatively well to keep up. The plot is even more convoluted than the second film and unfortunately it no longer has the wow factor, originality or nice fantasy element either. To be honest whilst watching I got a distinct sensation that I was watching deleted scenes merely pieced together to create another film. The film really does have that slightly disjointed vibe about it.I think one of the things that got me was the fact the characters just didn't matter anymore. In the second film Davy Jones was the terror of the seas with his firesome appearance, monstrous crew and pet Kraken (unadventurous end for that beastie), now in this film he is reduced to lingering in the background whilst people talk. A great character reduced to an extra virtually. Barbossa of course was the terror of the first film and he has now been slowly reduced to Sparrow's sidekick of sorts, then we have new character Sao Feng who really doesn't matter. He looks good and its a nice touch to see the Orient in the film but the whole setup is wasted! Again merely background fodder whilst we must watch Depp do his now overdone thing and the quite uninteresting love conflict between Turner and Swann.I might add that Knightly has been completely covered in makeup for this last entry, absolutely smothered on her face. She looks like an orange with thick eyebrows! its pretty bad and pretty obvious if you ask me, looks unintentionally amusing. Yet the sequences showing Sparrow's descent into madness whilst in Davy Jones locker I quite liked even though many didn't. I actually thought those scenes were quite original and well thought out giving us something fresh which is quite hard really, especially with the content you're trying to visualise here. The little moments of quirky insanity with Sparrow felt a bit Raimi-esque if you ask me, reminded me of 'Army of Darkness' and Ash going nuts whilst splitting in two. A bit of a stump in the films fluidity sure but it showed some ingenuity, giving some more uniqueness in-between the other bland action bits.Of course this being a modern day sequel the films gotta be BIG, REAL BIG! You want overblown CGI enhanced action set pieces then voila! I can't deny it all looks terrific and perfectly piratey but blimey gov! How overboard must they go...no pun intended. The perfect example? How about Turner and Swann in a blazing cutlass battle with hordes of bad guys in the midst of a booming sea storm. During this pitch battle to the death they shout out to Barbossa to marry them...he too is in the midst of a fight to the death. So that he does, we have an utterly ludicrous action sequence with all three exterminating every bad guy with ease whilst they get married. Now I realise this film is purely for fun and all ages, to a degree, but come on, did we have to go there? Its sequences like this that totally remove you from the film. Sure you gotta have some suspension of disbelief and that's why its OK to have some slightly fantastical elements but at least give us some small note of emotion, a small drop of actual realistic danger for the characters. No point loading up a brand new video game only to slap on the invincibility cheat and play through.It takes us awhile but when we do eventually get to the pirate convention in Shipwreck Cove the film does perk up a bit momentarily. The introduction of the pirate city council as it were...was a nice touch, some great looking characters there. I liked how they show us pirates from various different countries, different backgrounds and cultures, they are all well crafted if a little bit cliched too just for fun. But all this leads me to another problem, why couldn't we see more of these guys and less of the rest? The finale sea battle builds up as if we will see every pirate and his crew fight...what happened there?! We see Sparrow's Pearl go up against the Dutchman but what about the masses of other ships? All the other pirate ships? I thought they wanted to fight, instead they all watch? I think Verbinski finally realised it was all getting out of hand and too big, I'll just conveniently let the other vessels disappear for the last bit.In all honesty I had to do some internet/wiki research after watching this film to actually understand what happened here and there, get to grips with the plot. The whole 'Calypso' thing had me floundered for some time I can't deny, had to pinpoint exactly what the hell was going on with that. The piratey dialog while sounding cool, didn't help with trying to follow various sub plots. There are lots of nice fun little touches throughout the film which remind you what the film was previously...before it became too big. We all know the film is just too flippin busy, too much going on, I think they could of left a lot out or at least leave some characters out, have them tied up and done in the second film or early on. The whole franchise is terribly bloated when it didn't have to be. Its still a solid set of films with a good story, but the first film is the only one which is looked upon favourably, shame really as these last two films could/should so easily have been classics too.","25","Action & Adventure, Science Fiction & Fantasy","johnny depp|geoffrey rush|orlando bloom|keira knightley|jack davenport|kevin mcnally"

"pirates_of_the_caribbean_3","The last of the original trilogy and this franchise still didn't feel completely off the rails. Although there are too many twists and with the introduction of the Pirate Council, too many characters, this is still an enjoyable journey into this world which Disney have created. Luckily Depp still feels true to the character here and the scenes in the afterlife are great. Unfortunately the action takes a turn in this film and with the writing off of the Kraken in the last story the viewer is left with a feeling that a confrontation between Jack and the beast was left wanting. To add to this the Maelstrom battle at the end is not as exciting as it could have been as CGI feels like it takes over.

"pirates_of_the_caribbean_3","At World's End is an appropriate title for the 3rd Pirates movie. It's not only the end of an incredible trilogy, it's the end of what should have been the entire Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. Dead Man's Chest had some pretty silly humor. Unfortunately, At World's End is goofy to a fault. There are scenes where there are multiple Jack Sparrow's running around, while Devil and Angel Jack are both standing on Jack's shoulders. It's a little too ridiculous and not particularly funny. Being mindful, this doesn't ruin the movie; it's only a very small element of a massive production. A production that is perhaps too complicated with too many things going on at once. Davy Jones' storyline is further fleshed out, with Bill Nighy once again bringing another great performance to the forefront. Jack and Barbossa are back together, and their chemistry is fantastic as it was in the first. What impressed me the most were the set pieces, particularly the final maelstrom battle. It's jaw-dropping, ridiculously epic, and it looks fantastic, even a full decade later. The final act is truly a spectacle to behold, and is a prime example of how a massive Hollywood budget should be utilized. At World's End may not be the best in the trilogy, but it's a farewell that couldn't be sweeter.","40","Action & Adventure, Science Fiction & Fantasy","johnny depp|geoffrey rush|orlando bloom|keira knightley|jack davenport|kevin mcnally"

Johnny Depp continues doing his best, Teague Sparrow is an interesting character, Lisa and Turner are a beautiful couple, Davy Jones and Dalma are good characters but their accents are awful.

"pirates_of_the_caribbean_3","Better than I actually remember. Concluding the story from Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006) this film follows Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) as they attempt to find Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) who after fighting the Kraken in the first film is stuck in Davey Jones (Bill Nighy) locker. Along the way they have to team up with recently resurrected Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and gain passage to the locker through charts from Captain Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat). Meanwhile Norrington (Jack Davenport) has been promoted to Admiral and is hot on the trail of the pirates along with Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) who now possesses Davey Jones' heart. The movie easily has the best special effects of all the films (thus the whopping 300 million dollar budget!) and has some really fantastic action sequences. Where the movie falters in my opinion is the whole Calypso story line. First off I like Naomie Harris, but I felt like she wasn't the right person for this role. Not to mention when it's finally revealed that she is the person that broke Davey Jones heart it's kinda random how giant she gets and kinda cheesy. This plus the total serious tone of this film sets it off from the other films. There's some comedic moments of course, but man is this one a dark story it literally opens showing a kid getting hanged. Not to mention everything does get resolved, but man is that one somber ending! Overall, it ends the original trilogy here decently, but it definitely runs a bit too long (almost 3 hours run time) and has so many plot lines that without watching it several times you're bound to miss a few things!","30","Action & Adventure, Science Fiction & Fantasy","johnny depp|geoffrey rush|orlando bloom|keira knightley|jack davenport|kevin mcnally"

"pirates_of_the_caribbean_3","bad..... bad. really long and boring. a huge mess in so many ways, especially story and character motivations. sooooo many questionable and stupid parts that don't make sense and are fun to make fun of. an abhorrent amount of cheesiness and goofiness (first time using that word). so many omg moments. all of the characters are significantly less likable than in previous movies. things i liked: some beautiful shots and good directing, and the action scenes LOOKED amazing, even though most of them were so ridiculous and stupid. some of the acting in this movie is terrible. so many decisions make no sense. and so many scenes go on for 2 or 3 times longer than they should... (about 3 viewings)SPOILERSlike the crew of jack sparrows. or him talking to his mini selves.... wtfwhere do i start. lets see what i can remember. elizabeth swan is a slut who just goes around kissing everyone and can't decide who she likes. oh wait except at the end when she says 'you think i loved him,' implying that she only felt guilty for getting jack killed. even though they strongly implied in the last movie that she did love him, which is part of the reason i liked the second less than the first, they added a love triangle.omg omg omg, they wanted barbosa to marry them in the middle of the final battle. wow bro just wow. another thing, after they cut will's heart out so he can become the captain of the flying dutchman, he was immediately in a completely new outfit, mostly black to show is darkness lmao. so much of the story makes no sense. things just happen and you have to go with it. there was an entire armada, thousands of government ships ready to kill the pirates. but the two pirate ships just sail up to the main government ship and kill it without any of the other ships doing anything. 'Orders, sir?' let's just die. and then the thousands of other ships are like ok lets just go home. bro. bro.there are so many more little things. things that are done just for the audience that make NO sense. that are impossible or just ridiculous coincidences. all over the place. the whole calypso story did not impact anything. also how they unleashed her was so stupid, you have to say it as if it's coming from a lover. oh and jack sparrow can grab any rope on the ship and launch himself or even fly or create a parachute. there is so much more. this movie deserves a hilariocity review","10","Action & Adventure, Science Fiction & Fantasy","johnny depp|geoffrey rush|orlando bloom|keira knightley|jack davenport|kevin mcnally"

"pirates_of_the_caribbean_3","When push comes to shove, the Pirates films are about one thing and one thing only, entertainment. Amidst all of the nonsensical humor and action, I don't know how you wouldn't at least be entertained by what Johnny Depp & company had to offer.At World's End once again doubles down on everything that made the second film ridiculously fun. Except this time the film is a solid 2 hours and 48 minutes long. I guess if you're going to spend 300 million dollars on a film might as well make it lengthy, right? The length and it's convoluted and wandering plot are sure to annoy some viewers (it certainly annoyed me), but there's more than enough to make this another worthy entry in Disney's bankable series.After Beckett and the Navy managed to steal Davy Jones' heart and impose a ban on pirates across the seas, Will, Elizabeth, and Barbossa must form an alliance to find Jack Sparrow and come together for one final battle. There's a lot to like here, including some of the best choreographed and shot action of the entire series. Merely analyzing the final 35 minutes was enough to get my blood flowing. This series has never shied away from going all out with action and escapades, and At World's End is no different. I'm not even sure 50 percent of the films made today look half as good as this film does. However, there are always downsides to relying heavily on the spectacle.As I mentioned with Dead Man's Chest, the spectacle overtook any sort of uniqueness or cleverness to the script that made the first adventure so fresh. Johnny Depp is way past the point of over-the- top, and so is the film. You feel like there's real danger in the first film, but most of that is gone by the supernatural and fantastical elements they bring in here. Nobody expected to see Sparrow sit an entire film out after being eaten by the Kraken last film, but it sure seemed pretty easy to get him back. And when we do get him back, he spends most of his time talking to hallucinated versions of himself that refuse to go away. The plot also tends to always fall back on one member of the crew being either 'missing' or 'captured' by another ship/crew. It gets tiring after a while.I think they set out to make the biggest adventure possible, and you have to give the people involved credit for truly bringing it. But I can completely understand where people get tired of mindless action without much wit and far less charm than the first film had. But hey, I'm still having a blast going back and re-watching some of my childhood favorites.+Spectacle is unmatched+Zimmer's score is epic+Jaw-dropping action-Plot wanders-Lengthy7.8/10","35","Action & Adventure, Science Fiction & Fantasy","johnny depp|geoffrey rush|orlando bloom|keira knightley|jack davenport|kevin mcnally"
"pirates_of_the_caribbean_3","It is weird to see the transition from Curse of the Black Pearl to At World's End. Some may argue that the franchise is over the top and cartoon like, but this is a solid movie. There is a lot of ground to cover and it does it fairly well. However, there are a few shortcomings and pointless moments, but still a good movie concluding the first three films. The story is a little wild from time to time, but still manages to keep the charm of the original film.","40","Action & Adventure, Science Fiction & Fantasy","johnny depp|geoffrey rush|orlando bloom|keira knightley|jack davenport|kevin mcnally"
"pirates_of_the_caribbean_3","If Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End has one major flaw it's that it's overly long. I don't think it ever gets boring as many people do, but when the movie's over, it's hard to believe how much time has passed. I mean the movie is ten minutes shy of being three hours! But for Pirates' fans, At World's End provides more of the fun and action that we loved from the first two movies, just maybe a little too much more. Another flaw that people love to poke at this movie for is it being too confusing. While I readily admit that this film has way too many characters with way too many motivations and way to many plotlines, I never once found the movie confusing. I understood At World's End when I was 9 years old, so I would think most adults should be fine watching it. What I haven't understood is all the hate that this movie has received. I know a lot of people who bash on this film and it doesn't make sense to me when you consider how similar it is to the first two. This movie is a blast. You get to see the return of all the hilarious Pirates' characters. There's awesome action scenes, great special effects, and the music is breathtaking. Seriously, this movie by far has the best score out of all of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. Hans Zimmer changed it up a little bit and he knocks it out of the park. Now I understand the complaints about the movie being too long, and if I could cut out one scene it would be the Brethren Court sequence. I think it's a funny part of the movie and I like how you get to see the inner workings of the pirate politics, but it's feels really unnecessary as it happens towards the end of the movie and none of the Pirate Lords actually end up doing anything in the final battle. And speaking of the final battle, holy crap it's awesome! One of this movie's biggest strongsuits is how much it feels like an epic conclusion to the franchise. While Disney inevitably made more Pirates' films, At World's End is still the larger-than-life finale to the story arcs started in Dead Man's Chest and even Curse of the Black Pearl. In the end, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End gave audiences exactly what they asked for and I think it delivers almost 100%. And Jack Sparrow is at his craziest of the franchise in this one, which is either a good thing or a bad thing based on your preferences. (It's a good thing!)","50","Action & Adventure, Science Fiction & Fantasy","johnny depp|geoffrey rush|orlando bloom|keira knightley|jack davenport|kevin mcnally"

"dark_shadows_2010?","Dull, uninspired work from Tim Burton, continuing a more lackluster era of his career. Burton sleepwalks through his typical directorial tropes - gothic atmosphere, kooky characters caked in makeup, an ensemble of eccentric characters - while not showing any signs of a strong connection to the material he's adapting. Unsure of whether it wants to be horror, comedy, drama, or some sort of mix of two or all three, we slog through this inconsistent, unengaging narrative, packed with jokes that rarely land. Johnny Depp, once again buddying up with Burton, plays up his usual shtick, and eight collaborations with Burton into his career, this same wide-eyed quirkiness has become stale. The whole cast, in fact, is given nothing great to do: Burton's other go-to actor Helena Bonham Carter is bland, Chloe Grace Moretz is horrendously monotone (whether her angst-ridden teen role calls for it or not), and Michelle Pfeiffer's talent is wasted. The one standout is Eva Green, camping it up as a charismatic antagonist, the sole source of energy injected into a film that's otherwise dead on arrival. With her icy blue eyes and her wide smile, she's the kind of artistic muse right up Burton's alley: that is, old-school Burton's alley. The Tim Burton we know and love that actually cares about his craft.","20","Drama, Horror, Mystery & Suspense","johnny depp|helena bonham carter|chlo� grace moretz|eva green|gulliver mcgrath|bella heathcote"
"dark_shadows_2010?","A film that's all over the place, going from horror to sex comedy and just about everything inbetween, but despite featuring vampires, witches and more it mostly settles into a drama about rivalry over a fishing(!) business. This means it is endlessly inventive, the visuals even more so, and because it doesn't take itself seriously it can be entertaining, aided by the cast who are clearly enjoying themselves, but its chimeric nature means it's hard to get a grip on it and get into it. The threads don't come together very satisfactorily and Dark Shadows ends up being less than the sum of its parts.","25","Drama, Horror, Mystery & Suspense","johnny depp|helena bonham carter|chlo� grace moretz|eva green|gulliver mcgrath|bella heathcote"

"dark_shadows_2010?","Tim Burton has given us many a cinematic wonder over his many years in the industry. But, he has also produced and directed films which this description fails to apply to; an example of which being the 2012 film, Dark Shadows. Though an all-star cast and classic source material may have looked promising, this film only succeeds in giving us what is a frankly quite odd and baffling end result. Overacting by Johnny Depp and Eva Green is not helped by a forced and predictable script; this is tipped off by a messy story that is an uncomfortable mixture between horror, comedy and drama. Despite this, however, Dark Shadows is, at times, quite comedic and you cannot ignore the flair and quirkiness of the film. Most of all, the film is rarely boring and is still an enjoyable watch. This Burton outing, starring this lesser known Addams Family, is far from brilliant and only just good, but still manages to create an entertaining guilty pleasure.","25","Drama, Horror, Mystery & Suspense","johnny depp|helena bonham carter|chlo� grace moretz|eva green|gulliver mcgrath|bella heathcote"

"dark_shadows_2010?","Eight time dynamic duo, eccentric director/producer Tim Burton and legendary character actor Johnny Deep are together again to make more quirky camera magic. Based on cult-classic TV series Dark Shadows, a revolutionary supernaturally themed gothic-horror daytime soap nominated for an Emmy 1968, the odd story is as different and unique as those resurrecting it from the archives. A match made in heaven.One of the greatest pleasures when watching a film is being able to expect and embrace a distinctive creative style. From Edward Scizzorhands, Sleep Hollow, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Sweeny Todd and Alice in Wonderland to The Nightmare before Christmas and Corpse Bride, the captivating paring between Burton and Deep has carved a niche in the industry that simply no one can attempt to emulate.In 1752, Joshua and Naomi Collins take their young son Barnabas and flee from Liverpool England to America in hopes of new life and escaping the mysterious curse that has plagued their family for years. Two Decades later, the now rich, powerful and an incorrigible playboy, Barnabas (Johnny Depp) is the master of Collinwood Manor and has the town of Collinsport, Maine falling at his feet. The egotistical Barnabas makes a grievous mistake when he unwittingly breaks the heart of Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green). The wrong lady to scorn, Angelique is a powerful witch and dooms Barnabas to a fate worse than death, cursing him to the shadows as a vampire and burying him alive for eternity.Two centuries later, Barnabas is inadvertently freed from his tomb, emerging into the very different world of 1972. Returning to his rightful home, the once-grand estate has fallen to complete ruin and the dysfunctional remnants of the Collins family have fared little better. Each descendant harbors their own dark secret and hidden agenda; The matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer) attempts to raise her precocious 15 year old Carolyn (Chlo� Grace Moretz) whilst salvaging the failing family business after being sold off in pieces by her irresponsible younger brother Roger (Johnny Lee Miller). Roger, a recent widower (under dreadful circumstances) is the disputed father to a spoilt David (Gulliver McGrath), who is mostly cared for by the unflappable new governess Victoria Winters (Bella Heathcote). The whole family is being 'treated' by resident crazy psychiatrist Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter) and receives day to day assistance from the drunken servant Willy Loomis (Jackie Earle Haley).A family man at heart, Barnabas must exercise the various demons, witches, werewolves and ghosts in his endeavor to restore his estate to its former glory and his family to some kind of normality. A difficult and daunting task in its self but when his cuckoo former flame returns to destroy his eternal life once again, does Barnabas have the will power to survive her feminine whiles or will he end up buried in an even more compromising position than last time? Depp's ingeniously characterized peculiarities reach for new heights, Pfeiffer grounds the project with depth and gravity, Carter has her usual over-the-top presence, whilst the usually demure Green commands particular fiery attention. Cameos from Christopher Lee, Alice Copper and a number of the original TV cast accentuates the productions Adam's Family quality but touched with a hint of 1970's Technicolor overt hippiness. The Verdict: A novel step-back-in-time but with a distinctively modern direction, Dark Shadows brings something a little different to otherwise action dominated cinemascope to tickle your fancy. We can all use a little fun and quirk in our lives and why not get it from the source and reigning king of nonconformist in his most recent trek down the proverbial rabbit hole?

"dark_shadows_2010?","It is hard to explain this movie, because it is tragically uneven. Things start of so well with a narrated back-story where a wealthy young man in Victorian times betrays a witch in love with him in favor of another woman. The witch, played by the lovely and versatile Eva Green, enchants his lover and casts her over a cliff to her death. Depp's character is not so lucky, she makes him a vampire and buries him alive, incapable of dying and reuniting with his true love in the afterlife. This is all good so far; the sets and costumes look great, and the story is sound. Depp finds himself unburied in modern times and finds the town he once knew is now completely different. He reconnects with an enjoyable cast of decedent family members living in his old estate. The present-day family is quirky and off beat and full of dysfunctionality. It has upbeat sentiment as his loyalty to his bloodline compels him to help his new family. There is still a dark undertone to the protagonist though, because he is a vampire and must feed off the living. Three-quarters of the way through the movie, everything is enjoyable with colorful characters and a plot that has heart and humor. Then things unexplainably lose their way. The story rushes itself and devolves to expensive computer generated action scenes. Where did the personality and cleverness in storytelling go? It does not recover until the final scene and by then it is too late. Strong performances from Eva Green, Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, and Michelle Pfeiffer mean nothing when the director loses control this badly. Tim Burton shows his strengths in finding kindness and fun within inherently dark characters, but the story telling falls by the wayside as the finish line is in sight. It is a pity.","30","Drama, Horror, Mystery & Suspense","johnny depp|helena bonham carter|chlo� grace moretz|eva green|gulliver mcgrath|bella heathcote"

"dark_shadows_2010?","A movie that lacked so much direction that the original plot doesn't enter into until the last 2 minutes of the film. Tim Burton apparently had ideas for about seven other movies that wouldn't work on their own. He crams all of those ideas into this one movie, where they don't work anyway. In this film, once there is a plot point of any kind, it is either not discussed for 1/3rd of the movie, or it is immediately resolved that very scene, then we move on to yet another one. This movie has absolutely no focus what-so-ever. It doesn't know if it wants to be a comedy, horror, drama, or romance, so it decides to be one of those every other scene and it is just exhausting. The Bella Heathcote is in the film for a total of five scenes of the movie, and she is in the first few scenes of the movie as the main focal point. Johnny Depp is the focal point for the majority of the film, and decides that he loves her for no other reason than meeting her once, and walking with her on the beach once. This movie has no build up on any front, and decides to hit it out of the park without even battering up. Dark Shadows has no audience. It's one thing to reach a demographic, but be good enough for others, but it's another thing to reach absolutely no audience at all because of how vague the plot is, and how childish/adult oriented the movie turns out to be. There are some genuinely funny moments, and the movie has shown promise more than once through out, but these moments of glee are interrupted by large portions of sporadic jumps across the screen. There are times when we truly feel for Johnny Depp's character, and his overacting is actually humanizing to a degree of someone who was a fish out of water or a man out of his own time. Yet he still murders innocent people and handles his problems so blatantly bad that the sympathy for him is limited down to nearly nothing. It's a mystery of how Tim Burton wanted to play this film out in the first place. He obviously had some good ideas, but every single idea that is brought to the screen is soon wiped off in order for another to take its place. Then there comes the third act, where we are treated to the most uncalled horrorfest money can buy. Remember when I said there was no build up to this movie? The third act was the prime example. All of the sudden we are shown things that had absolutely no build up to it anywhere throughout the film. They are just brought to the screen and we are supposed to accept them, and after being beaten with so many random plot points, you feel like you've ran a marathon, and the movie ends with very little to recollect.This film is not worth the time nor the effort to attempt to watch. It paints an obvious picture of how hard times have fell on a formerly great director, and why it may be time for him to hang up his director's chair for good. Do not give this film the time of day unless you are just such a die-hard Johnny Depp fan that you want to see everything of his in the first place. Either way, you have been warned.","15","Drama, Horror, Mystery & Suspense","johnny depp|helena bonham carter|chlo� grace moretz|eva green|gulliver mcgrath|bella heathcote"

Her father leaves the family to seek his fortune in America. After he has left, the settlement is burnt to the ground, and many die. After reports of this, the father does not look for his daughter. Suzi gets evacuated to England, and learns other languages there. When she is a bit older, she expresses an interest in singing and show business, and gets a berth in Paris. There she meets Lola, another expat Russian; Cesar, a gypsy; Dante, an Italian opera singer; Felix, who runs the musicals that Dante stars in. Paris is OK for Suzi for a while, but eventually the Nazis get closer, and closer, then take Paris. After a period of occupation, it becomes clear that she should leave. She would like to stay with Cesar, but he advises her to go. Lola gets tickets for Lola and Suzi, and they get on a ship headed for America. Do they make the crossing safely?

"man_who_cried","Tengo opinion dividida en esta pelicula. Por un lado, el gui�n me pareci� d�bil, la trama no me enganch� realmente en ning�n momento y el cast, principalmente Johnny Depp y Harry Dean Stanton (con un papel muy peque�o) no se aprovecharon al m�ximo, siendo Cate Blanchet quien resalta. La pelicula esta ambientada primero en Rusia, Inglaterra y luego en Francia, justo antes de ser ocupada, pero como pelicula sobre la ocupaci�n nazi de Europa no funciona. Sin embargo, es un verdadero deleite visual, bellamente fotografiada por Sacha Vierny (leyenda que trabaj� repetidamente con Peter Greenaway, en Hiroshima mon amour y en Belle de Jour de Luis Bu�uel), siendo esta su principal cualidad (Christina Ricci esta hermosa...). Suzie (Christina Ricci), es una chica jud�a extremadamente introvertida, otro de los riesgos que la pelicula se toma para su personaje principal es que su dialogo es muy escaso, pero que por la expresiva mirada de Christina Ricci, logra transmitir lo deseado. Me gusto el detalle de la relaci�n que Suzie llevaba con su padre, pues para comunicarse y establecer vinculo, utilizan el canto en vez de palabras. Sally Potter hace un trabajo regular dirigiendo, con algunos encuadres algo arriesgados, aunque hay que saber que no es directora de cine de tiempo completo, pues tambi�n se dedica a la danza, a la m�sica y al teatro. Esta versatilidad de la directora es otro de los aciertos de la pelicula, pues las puestas en escena y los bailes gitanos, asi como el playback de los cantos estan muy bien realizados. Vale la pena darle una oportunidad, pero algo floja a fin de cuentas.","35","Drama, Romance, Musical & Performing Arts","christina ricci|cate blanchett|john turturro|johnny depp|harry dean stanton|miriam karlin"

But after reading the synopsis, I see it's not as light as I first believe; in fact, it's exactly the opposite. Everyone did a really awesome job, Ricci was an odd casting choice since I'm sure there's a bevy of capable Bristish actresses who could've filled the role, but Ricci is an indie sweetheart, so I guess it's not really surprising. Cate Blanchett (Lola) is as usual superb and Johnny Depp was so cute (but a hint creepy), but John Torturro takes the cake, he was simply awesome as the devilish Dante.

I also think the movie would have been a whole lot better if there was more focus on the music, contrasting each character's musical style as a way to express the differences and tensions of the time. Much of the history of this period is known and has been depicted. We know there were plenty of antisemites, the germans were coming into france, and all that. There should be some more depth to movies taking place in this period. However, the cinematography was great, as expected of a Sally Potter movie.

This movie is my favorite both from a story pov and for its incredible emotional impact- it brought my entire family to tears.

"man_who_cried","Huge disappointing film that pretends to be an epic film experience but fails on every level. You barely see Johnny Depp, but are forced to watch the lead actress who must be someone's daughter in the industry. You will be forced to hear and see opera nonsense and a horse onstage crapping. This film really sucks. The egomaniac opera star is a bore and full of himself.   The lead actress is terribly inexperienced and far too young to play the role.  This film is hardly worth anyone's time and if you enjoy an apparently 14 year old lead actress pretending to be 24, watch it. She is homely and plain. Depp is wasted in this one as well.  It will interest you to know Roger and Ebert have given this one their great TWO thumbs up nonsense. 'Sold out' to hollywood I would say.    ps, unless you like opera tenors singing all through the film, forget this film, it is extremely annoying.","20","Drama, Romance, Musical & Performing Arts","christina ricci|cate blanchett|john turturro|johnny depp|harry dean stanton|miriam karlin"
"pirates_of_the_caribbean_on_stranger_tides","On Stranger Tides is such a disappointing entry in the series and so much weaker than the original trilogy. I loved its locations, score and some scenes were quite fun. Jack is also reliably good and memorable. But unfortunately the other characters are boring and the addition of Penelope Cruz hurt the film tremendously. She was never a great actress and here she gave a mediocre performance in a very annoying role. It is a shorter film, but owing to its odd lack of fantasy elements, it is mostly not as exciting as the previous entries.","30","Action & Adventure, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Comedy","johnny depp|penelope cruz|ian mcshane|geoffrey rush|kevin mcnally|sam claflin"

"pirates_of_the_caribbean_on_stranger_tides","We all thought it had ended with the trilogy but no! As in this modern age there had to be a continuation, it had to be milked and a milked it shall be. New director, change of cast line up and a new myth to explore, this franchise has become the Indiana Jones of the era.This film takes elements from actual real history this time and blends them with classic fantasy. The real bits involve the legendary English pirate Edward Teach and his flagship Queen Anne's Revenge and the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Leon. Now this plot has relaxed a bit, its not a complicated mess of sub plots and tonnes of characters. Sparrow is off to sea once again to find the fountain of youth, alongside him is Barbossa who is now a privateer for the British Navy. At the same time Blackbeard is also after the fountain along with the dastardly Spanish and their religious thoughts. Each party has their own reasons naturally which does as usual involve some double crossing and twists.I must admit to liking the intergration of actual history into the plot this time. The franchise has slowly used various common old fables and sea myths to its advantage which has worked well, this time the inclusion of some real historic figures gives the whole thing a bit more class, credibility and a small sense of realism. Of course old Blackbeard has been given a slightly spruced up look with black leather top to bottom by the looks of it, aiming for the cool factor a bit too much methinks.Gotta say I didn't really like the whole supernatural power thing Blackbeard had over his ship with the magic cutlass. That seemed pointless if you ask me, if he can control the ship like that then why use a crew? His galleon has also been given a very fantasised appearance which makes it look like a unique ghost ride attraction in a fairground. Oh and his ship breaths fire out the front? really? Did we need that silliness? They'd probably burn down their own ship with it.Next to that we see mermaids which is about time really if you think about it. The fact they are actually fearsome creatures that kill innocent sailors was a nice touch if rather obvious. But that plot detail causes confusion with the main mermaid character who we are meant to feel for, but that's hard knowing her kind are merciless killers of the deep, plus the 'Splash' finale for her was too much cinematic deja vu.I think the film in general is let down by totally unrealistic action sequences that just feel implausible when they are suppose to be reasonably plausible. The escape set piece at the start is a good example, its overly long and over the top in every sense. Sparrow is leaping around like an acrobat (clearly a stunt double) and doing things that just wouldn't work, the worst bit is seeing all the English soldiers prat falling about everywhere trying to catch him, its cringing. We all know the franchise is suppose to be fun fantasy but apart from the actual supernatural stuff you do expect a degree of slight realism with some stunts. If it becomes too outrageous then it ceases to be fun and simply becomes a joke, what's worse is the fact its not meant to be that kind of joke.The film is full of these daft action sequences really, it looks bad because we all know Sparrow isn't that kind of character, we had Turner in the trilogy for that. So now seeing the campy Sparrow mincing about doing these big hero stunts looks stupid as its actually taken semi seriously. As I said earlier the plot does also go down the route of old Indy with the chalices thing and especially the finale for Blackbeard which is pretty much a rip off from 'Raiders' and 'The Last Crusade'.Altogether the adventure feels a bit flat to me, nothing much happens that we haven't seen before or made me go wow! Most of the characters are running low on juice now accept for Barbossa who is always brilliantly played by Rush. Cruz was a bad casting choice and did nothing whilst McShane wasn't all that intimidating as Blackbeard if you ask me. Kudos to �strid Berg�s-Frisbey for being gorgeously cute as the mermaid and Richard Griffiths in a small role as King George II at the start.On the whole very very average in my opinion, hyper stunt laden action sequences can't divert from the fact the film is actually kinda dull. It all looks terrific and very atmospheric in that Monkey Island kinda way but you can tell the difference in direction with the film, it does stand out. I just feel they have now used up most avenues of pirate legend both real and fantasy, I can't see what they can do in the fifth film without it being a complete rehash, especially with this struggling for a fresh look. Who's left to utilize? Long John Silver? Sinbad? YellowBeard? What other old creatures and myths can they possibly crowbar in?? Atlantis?The fact they even squeezed in the minute unrelated hobby of ships in a bottle shows how far they were stretched to incorporate anything remotely olde worlde and piratey into the film. I think this film just about manages to be semi acceptable but that's now it, no more can or should be done. I think Sparrow has had his moment in the spotlight, time to retire in the sun matey.","25","Action & Adventure, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Comedy","johnny depp|penelope cruz|ian mcshane|geoffrey rush|kevin mcnally|sam claflin"
"pirates_of_the_caribbean_on_stranger_tides","So what next? This film definitely feels like a cash in on the popularity of Depp's character in previous films. I also feel that with Depp as the only lead it just doesn't work. In previous outings the audience are always left feeling that Depp is a force in this world just out of reach and his motives are not always clear. As the main character these feelings are gone as the audience view it alongside him. My other biggest criticism is that this film really suffers from barely any time at sea. It was obviously a budgetary reason but to me don't make a film in the franchise unless you are going to go full out. The scenes in London were fun and the film starts with promise but from then on out it starts to struggle with no real villain and Blackbeard being firmly second place to Davy Jones!","30","Action & Adventure, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Comedy","johnny depp|penelope cruz|ian mcshane|geoffrey rush|kevin mcnally|sam claflin"

"pirates_of_the_caribbean_on_stranger_tides","If the adding of Penelope Cruz and Ian McShaw to the cast is attractive, it doesn't compensate for the fact that the film obviously isn't. It seems to have little to do with the first three of the franchise since it picks up every myth available (Foutain of Youth, Black Beard) and tries to make something out of it.

"pirates_of_the_caribbean_on_stranger_tides","On Stranger Tides is the fourth film in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise and possibly to worst of them all.I was disappointed in it for a few reasons.1. It was trying to just be a fantasy movie instead of an adventure movie.2. It was just boring.3. It didn't know what it was.It relied a little too heavily on visuals. They were not bad, there was just too much of it. There were moments that felt like the last Narnia movie, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. I almost remember nothing else, but to say that the movie is bad is not right. None of these movies are necessarily bad, they just stopped trying.Over all.

"pirates_of_the_caribbean_on_stranger_tides","Franchise fatigue has hit this series. Or hell maybe it's because Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides took too long to come out (4 years after the previous film), or maybe it's because they went down on the budget (300 million previously to about 175-230 for this one). There's a lot of factors, but the one truth to all of this is that this movie isn't very good. Gone are Will and Elizabeth and in return we have a self sufficient story here that just follows Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). As was hinted at the end of At World's End (2007) this film centers around the search for the fountain of youth. After finding out that the Spanish have found the location of the fountain of youth the English hire Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) to lead an expedition to get to the fountain before the Spanish. Jack is taken in by the English and forced to help Barbossa, but in typical Captain Sparrow fashion he escapes and runs into an old flame by the name of Angelica (Penelope Cruz) who has been posing as Jack and recruiting people for her ship. Well turns out not is all it seems. Angelica turns out to be the first mate and daughter to Captain Blackbeard (Ian McShane). Angelica uses Jack and his compass to find the fountain so that a prophecy for seeing Blackbeard's death won't happen. So it's a race to the fountain of youth where the crews need certain items for the fountain to work which include two silver chalices the tears of a mermaid and a soul to take! Anywho, although this may sound like a great story the plot itself is one of the weak points of this film. There's a lot of great action sequences don't get me wrong, but the movie drags too many times. There's literally filler throughout the film. Whether it's forcing the terrible romance between Jack and Angelica, or another subplot involving a missionary named Philip (Sam Claflin) and a mermaid named Syrena (Astrid Berges-Frisbey) who I'm assuming here would have had bigger roles in sequels if this movie had done better. Blackbeard never feels like a really good villain (especially after such a great job by Davey Jones in the last two films). And then of course there's Penelope Cruz. Man she can get very annoying in practically every scene. I don't know if her character was just written down for that, or if maybe she's just overacting, but fuck was this one a miss. This is a miscast if I've ever seen one! It's hard to recommend this one especially when it's not good! The first three are solid, but with the newest film coming out Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales (2017), I'm not exactly sure how much of this movie will even connect. Worth just a rental at the very least.","20","Action & Adventure, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Comedy","johnny depp|penelope cruz|ian mcshane|geoffrey rush|kevin mcnally|sam claflin"

"pirates_of_the_caribbean_on_stranger_tides","After the original trilogy, there wasn't much story left to tell with Will and Elizabeth, so Disney wished to continue the franchise putting a heavier focus on Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow. On Stranger Tides featured Sparrow at the center of everything, which can be a good and bad thing.I don't necessarily think it was the best idea to make Sparrow the only character with significant depth, but I also don't think having the story involve mermaids and an overly powerful supernatural villain either. The Pirates films at their best when the stakes are high but are also grounded with some realism. One of the reasons At World's End is a much better film is because there are stakes in that film. William's sacrifice feels earned because we've been with these characters for a few films. I never connected to anyone in On Stranger Tides because the writing never makes a considerable effort to flesh out the characters. The efforts that are made aren't very committed.As a standalone sequel, which is essentially what this film is, On Stranger Tides is far from awful. It has plenty of fun swashbuckling action scenes that the franchise has always presented. Ian McShane is pretty good as Blackbeard, though he doesn't really compare to anything Bill Nighy or Geoffrey Rush did in the original trilogy. But the film itself presents a far goofier tone than any of those films. Sparrow is even more over the top (believe it or not) and thus removing any human connection to the characters.I think it's best to treat this entry as a distant cousin people choose not to acknowledge at a party, because it has next to nothing to do with any of the other films (even the most recent film, Dead Men Tell No Tales). There are flashes of the Pirates we know and love but it's nowhere near as grandiose or as magical as its predecessors.+Flashes of greatness-Forgettable-Characters are getting a little too over the top5.6/10","25","Action & Adventure, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Comedy","johnny depp|penelope cruz|ian mcshane|geoffrey rush|kevin mcnally|sam claflin"

The action is alright but some of it feels artificial an thus less involving. The film does have a great sense of humor which is somewhat helpful, however the story is at best a little weak if not a lot. The characters are not really that well developed with the exception of Johnny Depp's character, when the title character is not as developed as his sidekick than it undermines as well as hinders any real involvement with the film. The main things that I took issue to was the Lone Ranger's portrayal whom the filmmakers make him look like a pansy and a coward which is that exact opposite of what the character is. The character's very weak origin story is another great disappointment, also the way the story is told is quite confusing in some parts (crazy meat eating rabbits?) and its occasional switching from present time and the past is quite confusing as well. Still the film does have its moments, its good sense of humor, some interesting characters, occasionally great action sequences, and a genuinely creepy villain played by Fichtner help elevate the film somewhat but not enough to be listed as a great film.","20","Western, Action & Adventure, Kids & Family","johnny depp|armie hammer|william fichtner|tom wilkinson|ruth wilson|helena bonham carter"

"the_lone_ranger","I hated this film on my first viewing but I think the influence of hating it came from the negativity surrounding it at the time of release. The film was an odd creation, why they decided on such a lavish story like this is questionable. My parents would watch the lone ranger and having that picture in my head lead me into a film that was bloated. I liked Depp in the role of the Indian and Hammer was okay but not the ideal actor for the Lone Ranger, very bland. The biggest issue the bloated film has is the idea of a lavish, grand and epic scope for everything, it tries to be the Pirates of the Caribbean for the west. The film should've been 50 million and focused on being fun, something like Shanghai Moon comes to mind. These mindless Hollywood drones throwing 250 million at this film are fools, the western genre is ready to come back but follow the footsteps of the earlier films and keep the budget manageable. I liked the film and while they try too much, it's the actors and beautiful DOP that elevates the film in my opinion, who knows, maybe my opinion might improve in a further 10 years. 29-09-2017.","35","Western, Action & Adventure, Kids & Family","johnny depp|armie hammer|william fichtner|tom wilkinson|ruth wilson|helena bonham carter"

"the_lone_ranger","GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Scott, the latest incarnation of The Lone Ranger is in theaters. Is the legend of the Lone Ranger still relevant to today s young people?SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Hard to say until we get a look at the box office figures.GREG: Pithy. The story opens with a youngster in 1933 meeting an old Tonto (Johnny Depp) who relates the post-civil-war story of the origin of the Lone Ranger. We re introduced to a very straight-laced John Reid (Armie Hammer) who is a district attorney on a train bound for Colby, Texas. Outlaw Butch Cavendish (William Fitchner) is on the same train and bound for the gallows for his crimes.SCOTT: Another prisoner sitting next to Cavendish is Tonto, who watches as Cavendish escapes with help from an unknown accomplice hidden among the Rangers. Reid is then recruited by the Rangers to hunt down Cavendish but the Rangers are ambushed and seemingly all of them are killed. Tonto finds the bodies, discovers Reid has come back from the dead, and concludes that Reid is an immortal spirit who is destined to work with Tonto to seek justice.GREG: Reid is the most reluctant of heroes. He refuses to use a gun and insists on bringing Cavendish and his cohorts in live to face justice. He wears the mask only as way to hide his identity and strike fear into the hearts of the men he is chasing down. Meanwhile, the railroad is coming to Colby and railroad honcho Cole (Tom Wilkinson) is trying to bring a new era to the West. Scott, this was a very long movie that tried its darndest to bring all the elements of the classic Lone Ranger legend (created by Fran Striker for radio in 1933) to a modern audience. This was tried before in 1981 and failed miserably. This incarnation was a full treatment with lots of action and special effects. And a lead actor in Johnny Depp as Tonto. I was concerned that Depp would be too quirky for the role, but I was pleasantly surprised by the sensitive approach he took which was seasoned with a tinge of whimsy. In fact the whole film was a bit whimsical. I m still trying to decide if I m okay with this directorial choice.SCOTT: Greg, I truly enjoyed the set-up of the movie, with an elderly Tonto relating the story to a young boy a half century later. From the get-go, we re drawn in and placed on the edge of our seats, waiting in eager anticipation as Tonto s story unfolds. The film s opening scene, featuring a little boy losing a small helium balloon as it floats just out of his reach, is extremely prophetic of the key themes of lost dreams and unexpected flight into the unknown. Overall, The Lone Ranger is a visually stunning film, with great attention to detail that deftly places you in the dusty, scorpion-filled old west. Armie Hammer and Johnny Depp are cast perfectly in the roles of the Lone Ranger and Tonto, and the supporting cast of helpers, lovers, and villains is also outstanding. Your question about whether this film has appeal to younger audiences, who have had limited exposure to the western genre, is an excellent one. Only time will tell.GREG: When I look at the current flock of heroes in the movies this summer, I see Kirk, Spock, Iron Man, Superman, (and soon) Wolverine. These are all products of technology or future worlds. Real flesh-and-blood heroes are hard to find in today s pantheon. When I was a kid, I remember playing cowboys and indians. Some of my heroes were Bat Masterson, Wyatt Erp, The Rifleman, and the Lone Ranger. My superhero weapon of choice was a cap gun. With the coming of the atomic age and the space race heroes took on a more technological bent. In my later years I looked to the stars for my role models.SCOTT: It s refreshing to see heroism portrayed in less futuristic terms and with less reliance on high-tech gadgets and techno-babble. It s also a joy to see a classic buddy-hero story that depicts Native-Americans so favorably and in stark contrast to the elder-Tonto s role as a zoo-like specimen in 1933. The title of the film belies the equality of the contributions of the two men. Tonto takes as much, if not more, lead here than the Lone Ranger himself. In fact, speaking personally, if my life were in danger I d rather have Tonto save me than the Lone Ranger, who comes across as more na ve and less clever than Tonto.GREG: I agree with you there Scott. This film clocks in at two and a half hours, which was a little long for my tastes. But we ve seen this with other origin stories (witness Man of Steel). The first half of the film is devoted to telling us the story of how the main character becomes a hero. Then the second half is filled with his first adventure. It just takes a while to tell both stories adequately. Another problem I had with this telling was how long it took John Reid to fully accept his new role as the Lone Ranger. While he wears the mask from early in the story, he does it hesitatingly and even discards it at some point. It s only after his adventure is nearly over that he willingly wears it as part of his new persona as a western crime fighter. I felt it took too long for this transformation to take place.SCOTT: Greg, it s weirding me out that we concur almost 100% here. The Lone Ranger is a visually impressive film that capably fleshes out the origin stories of both the Ranger and his sidekick Tonto. Although the action scenes are riveting, once again we have a movie that makes the mistake of assuming that more thrilling death-defying scenes are always better. I grew fatigued watching the Lone Ranger and Tonto cheat death over and over again. Earlier this summer, we reviewed the movie Mud, which proved that in good storytelling, less is often more. For a rock-solid western story of heroism and developing mutual respect between two unlikely buddy heroes, I give The Lone Ranger 3 Reels out of 5. I came close to awarding this film a 4th Reel, but once again poor editing decisions led to an overly long film that exhausted me as much as it entertained me. The hero story is outstanding and contains all the elements we look for: A call to adventure, missing inner qualities that are filled, characters encountered who fill important roles, and a satisfying transformation. I give the Lone Ranger and Tonto 4 out of 5 Heroes. Movie: Heroes:GREG: I agree again, Scott. I liked the device of old Tonto telling the story to a youngster so as to perpetuate the legend. I also liked the respect American Indians were dealt in this film. But I missed the things that made the original Clayton Moore Lone Ranger different from other western heroes: intelligence over force. TV s Lone Ranger was much more interested in thinking his way out of a situation than in shooting his way out. While Armie Hammer s Ranger never shot anyone in this film, he came across as a weak-minded pacifist. I didn t come close to giving this film anything more than 3 Reels. It was too long and, as you say, spent way too much time creating impossible situations. As a PG-13 film, this was clearly aimed at younger audiences. I m OK with that because I d like to see this venerable legend become a modern hero again. But it just lagged on too long. The Lone Ranger s hero s transformation took the entire film to accomplish and I would have preferred a stronger turn. I award him just 3 out of 5 Heroes.

The cast (apart from Johnny Depp) are decent, the locations are solid and a couple of action scenes (though somewhat idiotic) are ok at best. The rest of the film is stupidly and needlessly long, Depp as a casting choice for Tonto was a huge mistake, the script is bland, the plot is predictable, the humour is childish, it is tonally all over the place, though the action is ok at times a lot of it is either nonsensical or improbable and it just generally feels like a Western version of Pirates of the Caribbean. I am glad that this film bombed at the box office because it now means we don't have to suffer anymore of this via a sequel which is what was clearly being set up with this film.","10","Western, Action & Adventure, Kids & Family","johnny depp|armie hammer|william fichtner|tom wilkinson|ruth wilson|helena bonham carter"

"the_lone_ranger","Where do I begin? When the trailer for this film came out, I was extremely pumped. It came from the team behind the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise and looked like a badass western film. What sad is that this film has all the tools for success. It takes place in the lawless frontier, it has a great cast and some of the action set-pieces, especially the climax, is so well choreographed and exciting. The problem lies in the story and characters. With a western like this, especially a Disney one, you don't need this super complex story that is over 2 hours long for it to be interesting Although, if you do want to have a super epic complex story, you better have some dynamic characters... this film does not. I love Armie Hammer and I love Johnny Depp, but they have little to no chemistry together and their comedic chops are extremely lacking. With the first Pirates of the Caribbean film, Jack Sparrow, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann all worked well together because they all had enough screen-time to build character and empathy with the audience. Here, I cannot even tell 'the girl's' name in this film. Hell, I couldn't tell you anybody's name other than Tonto. That is a really bad sign that you don't even remember the main character's name. He is supposed to be this badass 'Lone Ranger' but instead, we get a wimp who doesn't believe in shooting guns... Okay, who was the studio executive to let that one slide? Overall, it's watchable. For anything, admire it for its locations, production design and action set-pieces. Unfortunately, that is not enough to hold most people over. People want to like and remember the characters in their movies and we didn't get any here.","20","Western, Action & Adventure, Kids & Family","johnny depp|armie hammer|william fichtner|tom wilkinson|ruth wilson|helena bonham carter"
"the_lone_ranger","Considering how Disney loves reimagining origin stories such as Maleficient, they should be more than capable of applying effective satire to create a new version to alter the racist origins of the story into something fresh and dynamic. A twist could have easily been provided such as the story being previously told from the wrong perspective and then presenting the genuine (new) one. The film instead played into the outdated narrative at hand and did so with a dry dialogue through awkward delivery that all streched out to a ridiculous length. The Lone Ranger had the opprotunity to be something more and there is little excuse for failure with their budget of $225 million.","15","Western, Action & Adventure, Kids & Family","johnny depp|armie hammer|william fichtner|tom wilkinson|ruth wilson|helena bonham carter"

"the_lone_ranger","This movie's dazzling cinematography and production design are sadly devalued by most other aspects. Armie Hammer is totally nondescript as the titular character, and Johnny Depp's deadpan eccentricity is increasingly irritating, not to mention his makeup is distractingly silly. 'The Lone Ranger' trudges along at a punishingly slow pace with tons of pointless padding, making it hard to believe it actually had two editors. It simultaneously takes itself too seriously to be any fun, and is too tongue-in-cheek to be compelling. Nonetheless I found it consistently watchable, if hardly entertaining, simply due to its splendid period detail, well-choreographed action scenes, and rousing score.","25","Western, Action & Adventure, Kids & Family","johnny depp|armie hammer|william fichtner|tom wilkinson|ruth wilson|helena bonham carter"
"the_lone_ranger","Desperate to recapture and recapitalise on the magic and money of his rollicking high seas franchise, Director Gore Verbinski has choreographed a film almost identical in style and energy. Swapping the smell of salty spray and feel of heaving waves for the grittiness of desert dust and ever expanding arid emptiness, The Lone Ranger is a massively expensive adaption with all the elements of a grand adventure but without the box office or viewer acclaim. Jarringly jumping between frenetic and tedious, modern (without even being set in today) and traditional, plastic and parody, odd couple and action heroes, comedy and drama, this film simply doesn't know what it wants to be and would have benefited greatly overall from a generous dose of editing. For those of you who do remember the source material, I would advise not to compare, this is definitely a case of different courses for different horses. Stunts are massive and the vistas are stunning, even if they are noticeable geographically incorrect (location scouts take note - 2010's Utah does not equal 1870's wild-west Texas).Wandering through a carnival in 1933 chewing on fresh peanuts, a young boy stops in front of a display reading 'The Noble Savage'. When an old man who should be a statue comes to life, the elderly fellow recounts a 60 year old yarn of unbelievable derring-do. On train route home to Texas, straight laced Prosecutor John Reid (Armie Hammer) meets off-beat native Tonto (Johnny Depp) when they are shackled together by gun-toting hi-jacker's and left for dead on a runaway locomotive. Surviving the accident only to join a band of Rangers and play into a murderous plot, Reid is once again left of dead but can that actually work in his favour?With the aid of tonto and his trusty white steed, Reid transforms from a man of the law, into The Lone Ranger, a legend of justice. The epitome of chisel-jawed decency, Hammer has a likeable air but lacks screen presence, especially in contrast to his centre-kick of a side-kick, Johnny Depp. Like his most bankable character Jack Sparrow, Depp inhabits Tonoto in his usual magically eccentric part fruitcake, part genius and all crazy style. There is glimmer of chemistry between the leads, but Depp seems to get more in reply from Reid's stunning personality ridden horse that his second-fiddle leading man. Thankfully, the overtly colourful Helena Bonham Carter's role is rather small and her unique brand of odd is somewhat controlled even as a lethal prosthetic legged House of Sin Madam. Much like the aforementioned, the supports are all caricatures of the much-neglected western genre.With modern influences guiding the project, there are some glaring tonal inconsistences between light-hearted humour and racially sensitive violence. Besides being somewhat offensive to certain audiences, it highlights just how for the wrong way film making is on the political correctness scale. Backstory, historical and geographical accuracy be dammed. The verdict: With all the negatives being said, the hi-ho silver speed of this movie is somewhat endearing and with the infectious anticipation of will they -wont they rendition of Rossini's William Tell Overture and other classic elements right there on the brink, the reluctant charm of this film seeps through into an enjoyable cinematic experience.

He takes out the dead body's heart and eats it. You heard me right, he eats a heart. This is coming from the same company that brought us FAMILY FILMS like The Little Mermaid! I hate this film!

"the_lone_ranger","131221: Waited in anticipation for this film as it seemed like a long time since the last western (though it really wasn't that long - Django Unchained). Attended on opening day and even paid extra for the Dbox seats (which are not even close to being worth the extra money in my opinion). Where to start? Think I enjoyed it overall. Some neat characters, including Silver, and some cool costumes/makeup. Got to love a Schofield. Experienced some good laughs as well. However, seemed a bit long, and a bit slow at times. And, I had read there is some controversy over Depp portraying a first nations person. And, I agree. Though Depp adds some comical moments, and is his usual, unique self; I don't really see why they couldn't have obtained the same results with a true first nations actor. When the action happens it's entertaining. And when the Lone Ranger song begins, you almost feel like cheering...though that urge goes away as the song continues for so long.

"pirates_of_the_caribbean_dead_men_tell_no_tales","It's not as bad as the critics say it is, but it's still without sins. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is a fun summer blockbuster with fun action scenes, awesome CGI, a terrific soundtrack, great cinematography, and a decent villain from Javier Bardem (Way better than Blackbeard). But to all those pro's, theirs cons. The performances from our new-coming kids (Kaya Scodelario and Brandon Thwaites) come off as wooden and like they have no interest in being here, to add to that, their chemistry feels very forced, the story is at times, a bit of a mess, Captain Jack Sparrow doesn't feel as badass as he was back in the first 3 where he would do this such as: sacrifice his chance for immortality to save Will, came back to save the Pearl from The Kraken, actually confront the villain rather than hiding (I mean, he did confront Barbossa and Davy Jones), and so on. The plot is the same as all the other movies, their are some subplots and characters in this movie that don't need to be there, but are, and it's humor at times feels very dull at times. Overall, Pirates 5 is a turn your brain off fun blockbuster that returns Depp to his iconic role and leaves you wanting more.","30","Drama, Action & Adventure","johnny depp|orlando bloom|kaya scodelario|javier bardem|geoffrey rush|brenton thwaites"

Javier Bardem is laughably un-scary and silly. Geoffrey Rush clearly doesn't care and while the new cast are trying their hardest they have awful characters. Most of the action is dull and terribly shot, except for a somewhat fun sequence involving a guillotine. The comedy is so unfunny it becomes cringe inducing. The film also has an atrocious ending that undoes the admittedly ballsy twist from a previous movie. Not recommended in the slightest unless you like boring and uninteresting adventure movies.

"pirates_of_the_caribbean_dead_men_tell_no_tales","Dead Men Tell No Tales suffers from not having enough Jack in it, the pacing is all over the place and the story is fine, but underutilized in too many plot points.

It is eventually a pretty solid film that is weaker than the original trilogy, but a certain improvement over the last worst entry.","35","Drama, Action & Adventure","johnny depp|orlando bloom|kaya scodelario|javier bardem|geoffrey rush|brenton thwaites"
"pirates_of_the_caribbean_dead_men_tell_no_tales","While slightly more enjoyable than previous installments, Dead Men Tell No Tales continues to prove that virtually nothing can save this murky franchise from the depths of what lies beneath. Johnny Depp, is as always, reliably cool as Jack Sparrow, although tolerance for the character will vary wildly. His personality continues to coast the film by, but its clear that the series has no idea what to do with the character, who just seems there for laughs and not really prone to any development of any kind. More noteworthy is the new young actors, Brendon Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario. Both do relatively fine in their roles and its clear that neither of them are taking the film too seriously. However, Thwaites character is entirely bland despite his best efforts but Scodelario's proves a rather interesting female character thanks to a subtle backstory and determined attitude, frequently outshining her male counterparts. Javier Bardem tries his best to convey a menacing performance as the villain, Captain Salazar, and arguably boasts an interesting backstory, but the inconsistent cg effects and muddled speech drown him out. If you've seen any Pirates film then you've already essentially seen this one as well. Not content with trying something new, Dead Men repeats basically all of the plot points from the previous installments, a formulaic adventure that follows the checkboxes left by its forebears. Its entirely predictable in other words. The directing duo do their best with what they can do but their necessity to follow what's already been done leaves them no distinctive marks on the franchise as a result. It is entertaining at times and the film occasionally manages to offset any inconveniences with timely humor and interesting ideas but occasionally the humor falls flat but its still crowd pleasing. Above all else however, the visual effects are simply breathtaking and they blend well the film's use of practical effects. The amount of detail and thought put behind the film's production design is also a neat touch. The action sequences are surprisingly dull, especially for a film of this calibre and despite the crew's best efforts, they still lack the energy to overcome a sluggish feel. Dead Men Tell No Tales is an occasionally fun and entertaining film that doesn't do anything new nor tries to offset its formulaic affairs.","20","Drama, Action & Adventure","johnny depp|orlando bloom|kaya scodelario|javier bardem|geoffrey rush|brenton thwaites"

"pirates_of_the_caribbean_dead_men_tell_no_tales","This movie is so meh that I forgot to post a review.I will come forward and say I am still a fan of the series. I will still probably go see the next movie, if they have one. Also, while this is a very middle of the road type movie, it is still way better than the last couple of installments have been. The writing is better, the direction seems better, and the story is not so random, well there is some randomness but its a Pirates of the Caribbean movie so that is expected.There really isn't a lot of negative about the movie per se. The only thing really cringeworthy was the CGI younger characters. Just didn't quite work for me, but I don't know if that is because the CGI sucks, or if I am just seeing things differently then others due to colorblindness (sometimes that throws things off). The story itself wasn't bad in most parts, a bit predictable but nothing to be shocked about.However, I am really tired of zombie or other forms of undead pirates. Seriously, couldn't they have come up with a villain that wasn't undead? Even on the top of my head you could pick up some sort of fairy/elven type thing. Call them Atlantean and maybe Jack screwed them over in the past. Hell, I would take werewolf pirates just to make it different. I did appreciate the Cthulhu nature of Davy Jones, but that wasn't enough for me.They could also avoid the whole paranormal creature hunting him and why not a human wizard, or the Catholic church with some mysticism (full disclosure I was raised Catholic so no I don't think they are Satanists and thats why they should be villains). There is plenty of options that don't involve the same undead CGI.However, like I said I would go see the next installment. Oh, and there is a stinger in mid and end credits so you won't waste your time too much if you wait for it.The good: Wrapped up some earlier plotlines... sort of.The bad: Nothing was bad really, just sort of blah.","25","Drama, Action & Adventure","johnny depp|orlando bloom|kaya scodelario|javier bardem|geoffrey rush|brenton thwaites"

I was fascinated with the way they had Bardem's hair moving like he was underwater, it brought a whole air of otherworldliness to his character. The story is kind of reminiscent of the first.

And Gibbs, who has always been a sincere friend of Jack, who stuck with him in any situation, didn't even falter or seem to acknowledge the weight of his decision at all when he chose to cut ties with Jack at the very beginning of the film. The franchise has been popular and mesmerizing for not only the world in which the films take place, but for the uniqueness and fascinating layers of the characters - all of which is completely lost in this film.And I haven't even touched on the whole slew of flat, unremarkable and uninteresting characters that are introduced in the film.","10","Drama, Action & Adventure","johnny depp|orlando bloom|kaya scodelario|javier bardem|geoffrey rush|brenton thwaites"

"alice_in_wonderland_through_the_looking_glass","(4.5 out of 6)When it is our time to see out our family's business and expectations to voyage in what we are meant to do. When we plan our time focused on business, we don't focus on our family. When we can't go back for lost time and bring those important to us back, and voyage alone. When we have been gone far too long that time doesn't matter when we are voyaging and discovering all there is to see. When we don't know what unexpected things time will show us at the end of our journey, to either regret or cherish the voyage we were on. When we see time asks for us to go on another adventure when it's time to return to some places we are needed once again. When we see time doesn't ravishes us all when it stands still for others waiting. When others don't have much time we seek out a journey in what fixes them. When we see time is what makes us all when it's either time to go or time to begin. When time is like an adventure we voyage in awaiting various destinations and journeys that we either use it wisely or poorly. When we see time controls everything, all there is in the past, present and future. When going back in time we know we can't change anything, and journeying through time we handle it with such fragility as we don't want what's already happened and not happened to meet. When time only is meant to be steered one direction and reversing back poses some challenges. When time tells us that not everything is too late to change when we still have plenty of time to do so. When time doesn't need no adventure at all or going back in the past, and no need to disturb the timely order when some changes leads to more time with the right moments to do so. When time was never meant to stand still but keep going on. When with time some wounds heal. When with time we can't change our past but can change our future. When time can't take from us is everlasting bonds we have with one another it's never lost. When time is precious from the nearest seconds we have, that we cherish and hold onto. When we don't know what time will bring to us whether it's our loved ones back, a new friend, a place we are always welcome to, and the discovery of what we learn from such adventures. When how we consider time when it's precious that we choose to use it wisely whether it's for business, family, or both when life is just an adventure that we voyage deeper within it curious of the wonders we will see along the way.","40","Action & Adventure, Kids & Family, Science Fiction & Fantasy","johnny depp|mia wasikowska|anne hathaway|helena bonham carter|rhys ifans|matt lucas"

The special effects are still nice, but other than that, everything about this film was SO BAD! The actors seemed to forget how to act. Alice's character had once again lost her 'muchness' and she was really just boring to watch. For some reason, the Hatter suddenly had a horribly obnoxious lisp that he didn't have in the first film. Time's 'accent' was ridiculous and just very stupid. The Red Queen talked like a baby, and it's not even explained how she met Time at all. Or where those VEGETABLE PEOPLE CAME FROM! The plot was very stupid and very boring. The Hatters backstory was very cliche, the Queen's story was very stupid (she hit her head and it just didn't stop swelling), and her WHOLE EVIL PLAN was to travel back in time to accuse her past younger sister of lining about eating her mother's tarts (again, very stupid).

It was solid family entertainment that actually had more depth than the first film. I am personally not a fan of the Disney live action fairy tale series. Jungle Book was the only one that was worth the price of a movie ticket. Cinderella was also a good film... that's it.

It truly is a great concept and it showed in this movie! The whole cast did a terrific job, and it looked like they had a lot of fun making this movie!

"alice_in_wonderland_through_the_looking_glass","Alice Through the Looking Glassdirected by James Bobin(2016)Six years after Alice in Wonderland directed by Tim Burton, Walt Disney Pictures, comes back with a new chapter of Alice's adventures, based on Lewis Carroll's fantasy novels. We find the same stars who played in Alice in Wonderland: Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatters and Mia Wasikowska as Alice Kingsleigh. The main character, Alice Kingsleigh is a young woman, navigator in the real world, savior of the world in Wonderland. In the first opus, she freed the Wonderland of the Red Queen's tyranny, and established peace by killing the Jabberwocky. Now, she has to help her best friend, the Mad Hatter to find his lost family.The action takes place in London in the XIX century. Alice returned to the Wonderland where she saw's her best friend, the Mad Hatter, he was really sick because he found something incredible, his lost parents were still alive! Then Alice started her mission find what was really happened to the Mad Hatter's parents...The plot brings you in an unpredictable world made of magic and fantastics characters. The story pull up to the origins of the Red Queen's dictatorship. The staggering special effects with the synthesis images and an entraining soundtrack help you to immerse yourself in this amazing world. Then the photography (about the real world ) is really dark, there are close-up, it makes an unpleasant impression by contrast with the brightness and the colorful wonderland.The costumes are originals, they qualify the characters personality. Johnny Depp's performance is really funny and spectacular by the changing of mood.Alice the main character gots humanity, she is helpful and courageousThen about the script, I think it miss a cult replica, like in Alice in Wonderland, the famous ��Off with his head�� which were so impactful. And the White Queen character is still hold back, it's a useless character. The film message is about time, at the end Alice understand that the time is not against us, we got the time into our hands, it makes reference to the White rabbit with the gusset.This movie is absolutely fantastic! I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves family movies.

"alice_in_wonderland_through_the_looking_glass","Alice Through the Looking Glass is, surprisingly, a well-made fantasy with a much better story and a tighter script than Alice in Wonderland. I was disappointed with Tim Burton's version of Wonderland, far too much CGI and what is almost totally lost in the computer translation is the magic. When the weirdness and whimsy of these stories take a backseat to a hundred million dollars worth of CGI effects, the result is simply boring. This film is easier to follow, focuses on a story with a problem and a goal, and wasn't any less spectacular in its effects. The result is a movie that feels much less self-aware. The pressure had to be immense on Burton making Wonderland, and this movie feels much less forced, and much more focused. Frankly, although Wonderland made real money despite the so-so reception, I was very surprised to see this movie made as a sequel with Depp, Wasikowska and the original cast. They make better use of them here, and I enjoyed this movie even more the second time I watched it. Simply superior to the first movie.","40","Action & Adventure, Kids & Family, Science Fiction & Fantasy","johnny depp|mia wasikowska|anne hathaway|helena bonham carter|rhys ifans|matt lucas"

In all of it's visual spender it feels as though these core themes simply don't resonate the way they could at any point.The wooden relationships between the characters are likely to blame, they often feel superficial without any context.

"tourist","The Tourist comes as proof that good chemistry is never guaranteed between two actors, no matter their caliber. As individuals, Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie are both undeniably talented, judging by their multiple Oscar nominations (and in Jolie's case, a win). That's what makes The Tourist so baffling: Depp and Jolie are so utterly unconvincing as a pairing. It's hard to pinpoint the one source that leads to such a mismatch between two very talented actors, because everything in The Tourist is simply a mess. The plot, involving a cat-and-mouse hunt for a missing �744 million, is needlessly convoluted and lacks refreshing plot developments. That, of course, is when the plot is front and center; other times, it seems to take a back seat so that Depp and Jolie can wear the fanciest of costumes while touring various European locales. The action sequences have no gravitas to them, and director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck captures it all with flat direction. Von Donnersmack has recruited an impressive cast here, including Paul Bettany and Timothy Dalton alongside Depp and Jolie, but, like the latter, wastes their impressive talent on characters that have nothing else to do than spout off exposition in hopes to make any sense of the plot. It's a pathetic excuse for a movie, an exotic caper flick that can't even mask its dreadful writing and direction under production value that feels properly stylish.","05","Action & Adventure, Romance, Mystery & Suspense","johnny depp|angelina jolie|paul bettany|timothy dalton|steven berkoff|rufus sewell"

"tourist","Scenic movie attempting to invoke an old-fashioned feel, hurt by an overly convoluted yet pointless plot, clunky and leadfooted direction, and ultimately damaged by the two leads delivering performances that seemingly belong in different stories and demonstrating no real chemistry together.

Little did Frank realize it was all part of a much bigger plan, one that would soon find him dodging bullets through both the historic streets of Paris and the winding canals of Venice.

Quickly finding himself in a highly flirtatious dalliance with an English traveller Elise (Angelina Jolie), Frank's woes seem all but forgotten.The supposedly coincidental meeting however is actually more an orchestrated encounter on Elise's part. Deliberately crossing Frank's path, Elise attempts to mislead all those pursuing her former lover; a criminal wanted in fourteen countries for stealing from renowned gangster, Ivan Demidov (Steven Berkoff).Set against the breathtaking backdrop of Venice and Paris, Frank's forged whirlwind romance quickly evolves into something more sinister, making him a direct target and thrusting him into a dangerous game of cat and mouse.Fraught with controversy; 2007 Academy award winning director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, initially sign on for the project but left due to creative differences only to return once original headlines Tom Cruise and Charlize Theron were replaced by the stunning Angelia Jolie and charismatic Johnny Depp. Full of intrigue and multilayered manipulations, this elegant, sophisticated and educated Boxing Day thriller is bound to be as beautiful as its setting.Published: The Queanbeyan AgeDate of Publication: 19/12/2010","10","Action & Adventure, Romance, Mystery & Suspense","johnny depp|angelina jolie|paul bettany|timothy dalton|steven berkoff|rufus sewell"

Venice is the postcard backdrop, along with snazzy hotels and parties and glitterati dressed to the nines. A couple of Bond actors show up to solidify the connection, should one have missed it. The whole shebang's only missing one thing: a leading male. Depp seems to be playing an entirely different movie than everyone else onscreen. Did the director assign this role, or did Depp choose it?

"tourist","I suppose the Depp downfall started with this dog and has only garnered momentum in the year's since. It's hard to describe how banal and lackluster this film is, despite the assumed star-power and plethora of exotic locations. Every character is a cardboard cutout, the dialogue contrived, and the big plot twist totally telegraphed from early on. When the highlight of a movie are the myriad of ways Angelina Jolie's lips are showcased, you know you're in big trouble. Thankfully, the film's 90-minute run-time provides some mercy.","15","Action & Adventure, Romance, Mystery & Suspense","johnny depp|angelina jolie|paul bettany|timothy dalton|steven berkoff|rufus sewell"

"tourist","Yes, The Tourist is not a classic. But it is neither slow, nor muddled. For those with short attention spans, who expect more action, perhaps louder action with high decibel levels and overwhelming special effects, this is not one of those films. It uses subtlety and nuance, and has an interesting plot. It makes more sense than The DaVinci Code. It is beautiful, and there is enough chemistry between Depp and Jolie to make it believable. I enjoy this film time and again.","40","Action & Adventure, Romance, Mystery & Suspense","johnny depp|angelina jolie|paul bettany|timothy dalton|steven berkoff|rufus sewell"

"tourist","The premise is fantastic: two of the world's biggest, hottest stars combine in an action-packed, humour-filled adventure in Venice. That's partly right. Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp are both just as they are described. The rest of the film's description is completely wrong. Action-packed? Hardly. It may have scenes which would like to call themselves action sequences, but that's just an insult to the genre. You may find a moment or two to laugh, but humour-filled? Please. What we are presented with is a dull, uninteresting, life-sucking 2 hours of Johnny Depp trying to be the only good thing about the film (he is) and Angelina Jolie swanning about with the same expression on her face trying to be sophisticated and suave (she isn't), coupled with a lacklustre script, barely adequate direction, terrible editing and a boring soundtrack. All in all, this film sucks.�When Elise Ward (Jolie) receives a message from Alexander Pearce, her partner-in-hiding, directing her to lead her tail on a wild goose chase to Venice, she obliges, using Frank Tupelo (Depp) as a fake Pearce in order to throw them off the scent. What results is a sadly underwhelming case of mistaken identity as the police go from believing that Frank is Pearce to believing that he's Frank and back again, all the while revealing the most tired twists in the book about our characters. By the time the end rolls around, if you haven't already fallen asleep, you'll be ready to strangle someone as they bring about their most condescending trick of all. It's an insult to the intelligence of their audience that the filmmakers believe that an audience would not only be taken in by such a trick, but in awe of their trickiness.�The script is dismal. With two, maybe three, good lines to its name, it is consistently bland, always dull and never more than slightly entertaining. It serves only to get the story from one place to another and anything else is obviously too strenuous for the writers. In fact, every line that raises more than a chuckle can be found in the trailer, which makes the actual experience of watching the film even more depressing.�Making the script even worse is the direction. It's slow, confused and seems to have been phoned in or made into work experience for a first year film and tv student. Strange seeing as Donnersmarck's other notable work, The Lives of Others, is widely acclaimed as incredible, particularly for its fantastic direction. The editing is heavy, lingering on every boring shot for what seems to be an eternity each time. A rooftop chase which should be thrilling and fraught with danger comes off as, once again, bland and dull. Nothing comes off as it should and the whole venture seems misjudged and all over the place tonally.�Jolie and Depp don't ever seem to know what they should be doing. Depp makes the most of it however, being his usual quirky self, but Angelina seems to have lost all other expressions bar one which she wears the entire time. It's strange that a woman nominated for an Oscar for her incredible turn in Changeling would be capable of such a lacklustre performance. Though, to be fair, she didn't have too much to work with in light of the dreadful script. Paul Bettany is similarly dreadful as Inspector Acheson, the kind of officer who could only exist in a film. Timothy Dalton's part is cut far too short, as he almost steals the film away from everyone with less than ten minutes of screen time. But in general, the acting leaves a lot to be desired. You almost miss the ridiculously over-the-top performances that Depp has offered up in the past. Almost.�All in all, this film will insult your intelligence, bore you to death and frustrate you to death by the time its ridiculous ending rolls around. DO NOT WATCH!�Defining Scene:�From the slew of terrible scenes, its gonna be tough to find the best one, but it might be the first train meeting. Maybe.","15","Action & Adventure, Romance, Mystery & Suspense","johnny depp|angelina jolie|paul bettany|timothy dalton|steven berkoff|rufus sewell"

"tourist","Semi-enjoyable, though primarily for how lame it is. Not sure why so many good actors agreed to appear, but they manage to generate some appeal out of the very little the script offers. Despite its shortcomings, however, the movie has two major achievements to its name: firstly, it demonstrates that a boat chase through the Venetian canals need not be in the least exciting, and secondly, it manages to make both Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp look unattractive.

I loved this movie! No, it wasn't brilliant. No, it wasn't flawless. However, it was a wonderfully entertaining film reminiscent of 60's British spy thrillers with a very different Johnny Depp and an ending that made the film. Clearly the high-tone cast saw something in it too. And considering the crap people do like, I am going to borrow a line from Roger Ebert.

"transcendence_2014","One of this year's more underrated sci-fi films, transcendence, may not be a groundbreaking science-fiction drama, but delivers what it intends to do. The film is smart, the plot is both simple and complicated in different levels. The performances are good. The photographic visions are mind blowing. And the scripts idea and conclusion, is challenging in both intellectual and moral aspects. So while the film may not be the sci-fi masterpiece of the year, it's definitely not as disappointing as many critics have claimed. It mostly looks like there's a negative atmosphere around this movie between film critics that looks ugly, whatever it is.

"transcendence_2014","GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Scott, it s time to rise above it all and review Transcendence.SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Rising is the yeast we can do. Let s recap.GREG: We meet quirky, super-smart computer scientist Dr. Will Caster (Johnny Depp). He has a plan to make super-smart computers that are self-aware. This is a state that Caster calls Transcendence. No sooner does he unveil his plans than he is shot with a bullet laced with a radioactive substance that gets into his blood. He has a mere matter of weeks to live.SCOTT: Caster s wife Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) devises a plan to immortalize Caster by uploading his brain and consciousness onto a computer. The plan works, but the same terrorist organization that shot Caster is now intent on thwarting Evelyn s plan. She barely manages to complete the task and she evades the terrorists, but her good friend Max (Paul Bettany) is not convinced that the uploaded version of Caster is actually him. The rest of the movie consists of Caster expanding his powers in big, frightening ways.GREG: Scott, Transcendence was a disappointing rehash of a number of science fiction tropes. With Caster becoming one with the computer he becomes more powerful than anyone can imagine. And since he is wired into the internet, he can be everywhere at once. We saw this played sweetly in last years Her where Scarlett Johansson voiced a computer operating system that eventually grew self-aware and left Earth for places unknown. However, in that movie, the super-aware computer didnt become a fearsome monster. It seems that people fear technology growing more powerful than mans ability to control it. You can go all the way back to the original Godzilla or even to 1927s Metropolis to see examples of this. There was little of interest in this movie and even Morgan Freemans presence couldnt save it.SCOTT: I agree, Greg. Transcendence fails to transcend; in fact, the movie should be called Regression. There s no new ground here, just some recycled ideas from Star Trek, such as the idea that (1) consciousness can be imported to a computer, (2) an enhanced race of super-humans can be developed and deified, and (3) a menacing race of villains with a collective mind can threaten earth. And as you mention, we have a re-hash of last year s Her, another movie that treats these issues with more originality and style. What is new is the idea that nano-technology can infiltrate the natural world, affecting clouds, weather, soil, and water. This added menace certainly takes the disturbing abuse of technology a big step further. But the idea isn t developed or pursued at all. One other criticism: the movie is slow-paced. It takes quite a while for the plot to move forward, and so when we finally get to the meat and potatoes, and we are disappointed to see that the meal is the same one we ve been served before, although not as tasty as before.GREG: I ve noticed a lot of your metaphors deal with food. I should feed you before we write these reviews. The hero in this story appears to be Caster s wife Evelyn. She is the one whom we follow from the beginning to the end of the story. As such, she s a pretty weak hero. She displays a lot of the characteristics of the hero including selflessness and caring. But she just follows Caster s direction without much thinking about the ramifications of the ideas. And she doesn t really have any missing inner qualities to transcend either. She pretty much just sleepwalks through this film. The Max and Tagger characters (Freeman) are also heroic in their attempts to stop Caster. Max is the only one who transforms in any significant way as he realizes that Caster isn t the man he once was. As Max is quite the secondary character I don t count him as a hero.SCOTT: Greg, I think we can agree that the movie starts out as a buddy hero story, with Caster and Evelyn serving as a duo working together to promote positive uses of technology. But as you note, Evelyn emerges as the lone hero while Caster evolves into the villain. The heroes and villains flip-flop half-way through the movie, with Caster turning evil and the terrorists anti-technology position looking increasingly smart and reasonable. Johnny Depp seems out of his element here, as he s miscast as a scholarly intellectual. Depp is effective in dark, mysterious, quirky roles but he seems out of place here. I felt badly for Morgan Freeman, who as you say is a good man and good actor trapped in a bad movie. The secondary characters do a pretty good job with their roles but there is so much that is derivative here that my attention was shot to hell half-way through the movie.GREG: You make a good point, Scott. The villains at the beginning of the movie were pretty villainous. They shot and killed a man (Caster) to prevent what they thought was universal armageddon. That s a pretty heinous act. Then about halfway through they emerge as the good guys in the face of Caster s greater villainy. I found it hard to overcome their terrorist acts and see them as heroes. Caster as a villain really took a while to emerge. As you point out, we have seen this sort of villain even recently. Dr. Zola in last week s Captain America: The Winter Soldier was another scientist transferred into a computer system. And Caster was a pretty weak villain at that. One good thing about this villain that we haven t seen up to this point is the fact that we get a backstory to him. We saw that he was a good guy until his consciousness was transferred into the computer. Then the wealth of worldwide computing power corrupted him and he was bent on worldwide control. It s pretty rare for us to get a look at the Villain s Journey in a movie.SCOTT: Transcendence is a derivative story of technology run amok. It s science fiction that would delight and amaze us only if we lived in the 1950s. The film is mildly entertaining in places, and it did make me think, albeit briefly, about the consequences of nano-technology taking over the natural world. But there s precious little new ground broken here, and with Depp miscast as a scholar, I had trouble swallowing much of the story. I can only muster up one single solitary Reel out of 5. The hero story is interesting insofar as we see our initial hero, Caster, devolve into a villain character. His wife Evelyn then assumes the role of the lone hero, but she s ill-equipped for the task, showing an inability to think critically about her husband s unbridled ambition. She s not much of a hero, and so all I can give her is a puny 2 Heroes out of 5. Greg, you are absolutely right about the one strong point of the movie being its focus on the step-by-step development of a villain from scratch. We must also ask ourselves whether Caster made bad choices or if his turn to evil was solely a product of his digitization. We know that power corrupts and so the answer may not be clear-cut. Because of this in-depth treatment of villainy, I m going to give Caster 3 Villains out of 5. Movie: Heroes: Villains:GREG: There s not much for me to add. This was a pretty terrible movie and I don t see any reason to give it more than one Reel out of 5. The hero Evelyn was lost and waffling for most of the story. She pretty much does the bidding of the computer/scientist until the very end. It s a pretty dull hero s journey which I can only give 1 out of 5 Heroes. And finally, looking at Caster as the villain I was going to give him a score of just 1 Villain. But I m incrementing it to 2 Villains out of 5 because we see a bit of the villain s journey for the first time this year. Movie: Heroes: Villains:","10","Drama, Science Fiction & Fantasy","johnny depp|paul bettany|rebecca hall|morgan freeman|kate mara|cole hauser"

"transcendence_2014","This is a greeat movie. Maybe not a masterpiece, but an interesting and compelling story played out by a great cast and wonderful visuals. It might actually have been better as a miniseries where the characters and story could have been developed further and have more depth. It's a story that is not trying to warn against the dangers of technology, but the dangers of human stupidity and prejudice. Our inherent flaws and the need to overcome them if we are to evolve. I guess you could just not like that message.. or maybe your not a fan of the genre.. but in that case, you should realize a fair review is unlikely. I say this, because its perplexing to me the very low score this movie has. I can only say they are wrong. I understand some may not like this kind of movie or even object to it's message.

I've seen several reviews trying to oversimplify the film as some sort of a preachy, Al Gorian, Luddite warning against the dangers of over-ambition and reliance on technology.

I like Ex-machina...but, in my opinion, that movie was not nearly as epic or as beautiful as this film. The ending was very intense and I would say as close to perfect as I would hope.

"transcendence_2014","An anomaly like this happens every now and again. A movie will come out, get savaged by critics, and bomb at the box office. Then I'll stumble across it by happenstance a couple years later and...end up loving it. (A recent example of this would be 'Terminator Genisys,' but you could trace this back to movies like 'The Cable Guy' and 'The Frighteners' too.) Such is the case with 'Transcendence,' the 2014 sci-fi film that marked the directorial debut of Wally Pfister, the ace cinematographer best known for his Oscar-nominated work in many of Christopher Nolan's films. The movie had so many factors in its favor-a great cast led by one of the biggest movie stars in the world, a director with a sharp eye for visual flair, an intriguing, thought-provoking storyline-that it's sort of puzzling to try and figure out exactly what went wrong here. Perhaps it was mis-marketed? That might explain its poor box office receipts, and to be honest, it doesn't really surprise me that this wasn't a big hit commercially. It can be hard for films with heady, sci-fi themes (non-action based ones, at least) to find a wide audience. But the critics? Their overwhelmingly negative response kind of surprises me. I feel like they just missed the boat on this one, as I found 'Transcendence' to be an intelligent, beautifully shot movie that encompasses many different genres. The chief one is undoubtedly sci-fi, but there are elements of a thriller, a film noir, a love story, a heart-breaking tragedy, a cautionary tale, and even a touch of horror. Admittedly the film's overall message is something that's been done dozens of time before, but that's not to say 'Transcendence' doesn't have some interesting ideas. Johnny Depp stars as Dr. Will Caster, a renowned scientist who has been working for years on creating a sentient form of artificial intelligence. He believes that such a breakthrough will take mankind to new technological heights, completely altering human civilization for the better. His beliefs are not universally shared, however, particularly by an underground terrorist group known as R.I.F.T. ('Revolutionary Independence From Technology'), which operates on the principles that man has become too reliant on technology. Therefore, they view the implications of Will's research as especially dangerous, and they successfully stage an attack that leaves the scientist at death's door. With no options left, Will's wife (Rebecca Hall) and best friend (Paul Bettany) come up with a desperate plan: upload Will's consciousness, cognizance and knowledge-essentially, his entire mind-into the A.I. program he had already begun developing. The thought is that, with a human mind as a building block, they'll finally be able to create a form of A.I. that is truly self-aware; basically, it'd be a living, sentient computer program. Will would really be a man in the machine. The transition appears to be successful as the program begins to speak in Will's voice and even recreates his appearance digitally. The program claims that it actually IS Will; after all, it was Will's mind that was transferred into the machine. Ah, but is it actually Will? His wife is completely convinced that it is. Bettany's character is not so sure. Surely it can't be considered 'human' if it has no flesh and bone body. But then again, is it our bodies that truly defines us as human? What about the other factors? What about our minds? Or, if you want to get spiritual, what about our souls? This iteration of Will Caster has a mind and, in a way, has a body. But a soul... I don't really want to delve too much further into the plot. (Suffice it to say, like 'The Terminator' or 'The Matrix' or any other film involving A.I. getting a little too smart, things don't exactly go as planned.) But these are the kind of thoughts the movie encourages, and again, while it's definitely been done before, that doesn't lessen the experience. 'Transcendence' is beautifully executed, finding a nimble balance between hard science fiction and existentialism. I've said it dozens of time before, but execution is the key to everything. And under the skilled eye of Pfister, the film delivers some hauntingly beautiful imagery. In one of the movie's most refreshing touches, the climax occurs in a fashion you might not be expecting. The movie seems poised to go one way, which truthfully is the pretty clich�d route, but then ends up deviating in a manner I found most satisfactory. More than anything, the resolution just feels...human. Authentic. Organic. It doesn't feel like it's driven by the demands of the Hollywood machine. Kudos to writer Jack Paglen for bucking the trend here. With a film that keeps grappling with the notion of what it is to be human, I'm glad it ended in a way that seemed faithful to all that came before it. Perhaps 'Transcendence' will find a cult following in a few years. A few select elements of this particular film type are certainly there. But ultimately, I doubt it. It falls into that gray area of being too weird or deep for mainstream audiences, but not quirky enough to appeal to the fringe folks. But I'm certainly glad I came across it. In my opinion, it's definitely a forgotten, misunderstood gem.","50","Drama, Science Fiction & Fantasy","johnny depp|paul bettany|rebecca hall|morgan freeman|kate mara|cole hauser"

It's about Johnny Depp is playing yet another eccentric strange person (shocker) and he's some art guy,he's super rich but he owes so much money in taxes then Ewan McGregor hires him to find this stolen painting and there working together and his wife is played by Gwynteth Paltrow and theirs some love triangle between the three even though its not really. She won't kiss her husband because of some stupid mustache gag that plagues the movie.Johnny Depp bombs every line he tries because he's not likable the characters are not likable which leads to bad performances from just about everyone who for some reason is in this thing. I mean I miss the good old Johnny Depp but his films are becoming a bit pretentious lately and horrible just really horrible, I mean come on man.I mean it gets worse every time he's playing these eccentric strange people. I have no idea what Ewan McGregor is doing here I mean the guy is such a talent and in this he's just not funny. Paul Bettany plays Mortdeci's servant and all he does is be like 'yes sir, I'm fine sir, you shot me sir.' it's really annoying. Gwyneth Paltrow and Olivia Munn yeah their fun to look at but I have to say their wasted and I did not find them funny or enjoyable.This movie just sucks balls, it's already a little worse for me then Taken 3 and Blackhat which I also hated and this film can just be flushed down the toilet.

And if Mortdecai is any indication of what Depp wants to do with the remainder of his career, then he can head straight to DVD with this nonsense. Mortdecai follows an art dealer who is brought in to help find a stolen painting. First off, this film doesn't know if it wants to be goofy family fun or a dirty, raunchy film geared towards the older crowd. Frankly, it fails on both ends, so that isn't much of an issue. What is an issue is the writing. The film tries to introduce so many characters and open up so many subplots, and it all comes crashing down in a heap of garbage. And the acting certainly doesn't help elevate the trash. Everyone seems to be at odds when it comes to their portrayals. Some take it too seriously, some play it off too goofily, and some feel like they were ripped out of a cheap Wes Anderson knockoff. Fortunately, and this is the only saving grace, Paul Bettany gets a couple decent jokes. Other than that, the film slogs along to the end of it's mercifully short runtime and it leaves the viewer with yet another entry in Johnny Depp's rapid decline.","05","Action & Adventure","johnny depp|gwyneth paltrow|ewan mcgregor|olivia munn|jeff goldblum|paul bettany"

"mortdecai","A somewhat strange story, albeit an entertaining one. Although I found this film quite enjoyable, this crime-mystery, action spoof is admittedly, an acquired taste.In the spirit of the 70's book that inspired it, the humour can be quite dated, yet not to the extent that the film becomes tedious or, dare I say 'unfunny', at any point. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and with a character named Jock Strapp, you can't either. Also, as spoofed as it might be, all the acting talents remain on top form!Several sub-plots ultimately tie in to a rather satisfying end, and I must say, as much as its 'anti-hero' is dissolute, he's also rather charming! Personally, I found it to be incredibly good fun, but by no means is it intended for everybody. As for the accents, the stars do us English proud, and Johnny Depp's Charlie Mortdecai accent is pure gold! I am incredibly envious of their abilities to pull off something so different from their native twangs.","45","Action & Adventure","johnny depp|gwyneth paltrow|ewan mcgregor|olivia munn|jeff goldblum|paul bettany"

"buy_the_ticket_take_the_ride","Written by Tom MarksburyDirected by Tom ThurmanIt is no accident or coincidence that the title of this documentary is also one of Hunter S. Thompson's favorite and most oft-quoted sayings. It is also the code or credo by which he lived his tumultuous and rabble-rousing life, and one which was lived on his own terms and conditions, reckless as they might have been all the way up to his self-inflicted death.This film is different from Breakfast with Hunter in the sense that it doesn't so much explore Hunter's life, instead it memorializes it. Instead of examining, it merely remembers, although with a very sympathetic heart as evidenced through the interviews with such a vast array of characters such as journalists Ed Bradley, William F. Buckley, writers Nick Tosches and Tom Wolfe, and actors Gary Busey, Johnny Depp, Bill Murray, John Cusack, Sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro, Harry Dean Stanton, to artist Ralph Steadman, the local country Sheriff Bob Braudis, and even Governor (and former Presidential candidate) George McGovern. With such an interesting array of friends, you'll be sure that there was a very interesting and diverse man behind this collection of memories.Most of the film spends time with the people who knew him telling stories from his life, Johnny Depp telling about his months of living in Hunter's basement in preparation of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, the same for Bill Murray, but also discussions of their political history together, along with such noted authors as Tom Wolfe explaining why he was in fact the most important comedic American writer probably of the entire 20th century.The knowledge gained from watching this documentary may not be as enlightening as other Hunter S. Thompson documentaries, but that is not the intent of this film. It's merely a memorial, a tribute to the man, myth, and legend that is Hunter Thompson.Some of the stories will have you cracking up, such as George McGovern recalling the 1972 presidential campaign and Thompson's passionate hate for Richard Nixon, to the creation of his Gonzo Fisted Memorial Cannon, for which Johnny Depp paid $3 million or so. Such is the man in question though, whose presence is so sorely missed, yet at the same time understood by his friends and colleagues.Football Season Is Over'No More Games. No More Bombs. No More Walking. No More Fun. No More Swimming. 67. That is 17 years past 50. 17 more than I needed or wanted. Boring. I am always bitchy. No Fun �?? for anybody. 67. You are getting Greedy. Act your old age. Relax �?? This won't hurt'.And so goes Thompson's final journal entry in life, left on his typewriter for all to see. A fitting and ultimately expected end, as he used to tell his friend Ralph Steadman 'I'd feel trapped in this life if I didn't know that at any moment I could commit suicide.'8.6/10","40","Documentary, Special Interest","nick nolte|johnny depp|sean penn|bill murray|benicio del toro|tom wolfe"

"buy_the_ticket_take_the_ride","This is a wonderful journey into the life of one of the greatest writers of our time; as told by those who knew and loved Hunter S Thompson. While his death was tragic, it was not a shock or even a surprise to those who knew him best. Thompson proved that when an artist immerses their self in their art, it ultimately is their death. The scene in the film where the suicide note is read is chilling , and yet poetic, because Thompson expresses the finality of his life, his art, and his last thought so vividly in just a few sentences. Hunter S. Thompson was a self destructive man in search of the story no matter where it took him, and I think his friends do him justice by this documentary. If you have any interest in the man you just cannot miss this film.","40","Documentary, Special Interest","nick nolte|johnny depp|sean penn|bill murray|benicio del toro|tom wolfe"

More on Johnny Depp, Bill Murray and Sheriff Bob. Keep Sean Penn and Harry Dean Stanton and few others. The rest could have gone to deleted scenes or extras. Disappointed that had hardly anything on first wife, Sandi. She was very important to Hunter's life. Gary Busey was funny and comical. Much more interesting than sycophantic interviews by celebrity friends. However, could have used more effectively for better juxtaposition or contrast.If you want to watch a good documentary minus saccharine taste: Bukowski: Born into This and Crumb.
